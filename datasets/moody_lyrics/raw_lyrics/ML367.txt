Well I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home

Well now I'm living wild and dangerously
But I've got plenty of company
When the moon comes up and the sun goes down
Well I can't wait to see the lights of town

'Cause I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home

Well, I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home

Hey now, a pretty little girl and a jug of wine
Well that's what it takes to make a honky tonk time
With the juke box moaning those honky tonk sounds
Well I can't wait to lay my money down

'Cause I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home

I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home
