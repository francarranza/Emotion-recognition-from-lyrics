Baby you'll find
There's only one love
Yours and mine
I've got so much love

And needing you so
My love for you
I'll never let go
I've got so much love

All I want is to hold you
Let me show how much I love you baby (Show you)
I don't mind and I don't mind (Loving you)
Girl I love you
There's no one above you

You are the sun
You are the rain
That makes my life this foolish game
You need to know
I love you so
And I'd do it all again and again

Tell me it's true
I can't believe you do what you do
I've got so much love
And my love you'll see
We'll stay together, just you and me
I've got so much love

Only you (know me)
Tell me how to love you baby (show me)
I don't mind and I don't mind (tell me)
Girl, I love you
Always thinking of you

You are the sun
You are the rain
That makes my life this foolish game
You need to know
I love you so
And I'd do it all again and again

I know you know the way I feel
And I need your love for always
'Cause when I'm with you
I fall in love
Again and again and again, Baby.

You are the sun
You are the rain
That makes my life this foolish game
You need to know
I love you so
And I'd do it all again and again
