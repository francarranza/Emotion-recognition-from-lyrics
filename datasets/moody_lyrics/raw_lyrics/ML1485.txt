Takes a man to figure out
Makes my heart to carry out
You leave me hanging, baby
We've been trying much too long
To get in on
It's never easy maybe

This just isn't right
You being gone all night
This is how you try to keep me home

You seem not to care
What was ours to share
You were never there
To keep me warm

You're just saying things
Your (???) never rings
The trouble that it brings
Just puts me down

This just isn't right
You being gone all night
This is how you try to keep me home

This just isn't right
You being gone all night
This is how you try to keep me home

You seem not to care
What was ours to share
You were never there
To keep me warm

You're just saying things
Your (???) never rings
The trouble that it brings
Just puts me down

This just isn't right
You being gone all night
This is how you try to keep me home

Keep me home
Keep me home
Keep me home
Keep me home
Keep me home
Keep me home
Keep me home

Keep me home

Keep me home

Keep me home

Keep me home

Takes a man to figure out
Makes my heart to carry out
You leave me hanging, baby
We've been trying much too long
To get in on
It's never easy maybe

Keep me home
Keep me home
Keep me home
Keep me home
Keep me home
Keep me home
Keep me home

Keep me home
Keep me home
Keep me home
Keep me home
Keep me home
