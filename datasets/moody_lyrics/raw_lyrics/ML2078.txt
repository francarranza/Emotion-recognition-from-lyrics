Picture sunrise
Picture moon glow
Love do you know
Nature had her way with you, with you

Eyes of fire
Lines of laughter
It's no wonder
Nature had her way with you, with you

Extensions of each other
Born to one another
Extensions of each other
Born to one another in love
Born to one another in love
Born to one another in love
