I gave you all the love I got
I gave you more than I could give
Gave you love
I gave you all that I had inside
And you took my love
You took my love

Didn't I tell you what I believe
Did somebody say that
A love like ours won't last
Didn't I give you all that I got to
Give, babe

I gave you all the love I got
I gave you more than I could give
I Gave you love
I gave you all that I had inside
And you took my love
You took my love

I keep trying
I keep trying for you
There's nothing like you and I
Baby

This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love

When you came my way
You brightened every day
With your sweet smile

Didn't I tell you what I believe
Did somebody say that
A love like ours won't last
Didn't I give you all that I got to
Give, baby

This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love

I keep trying

I keep trying
I keep trying for you
There's nothing like you and I
Baby

This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love

Keep crying for you
Keep trying for you
Keep crying for you

Keep crying for you
Keep trying for you
Keep crying for you

Keep crying for you
Keep trying for you
Keep crying for you

Keep crying for you
Keep trying for you
Keep crying for you
