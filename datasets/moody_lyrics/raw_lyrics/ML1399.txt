Boy do you hear me say
Do you hear me say now
Love ain't far
Well I didn't mind, I didn't mind, I didn't mind
You can't hurry love
You can't hurry love

Boy do you hear me say
Do you hear me say now
Love ain't far
Well I didn't mind, I didn't mind, I didn't mind
You can't hurry love
You can't hurry love

You can't hurry love
You can't hurry love
You can't hurry love
