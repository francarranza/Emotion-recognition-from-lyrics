Hey there lonely girl
Lonely girl
Let me make your broken heart like new
Hey there lonely girl
Lonely girl
Don't you know this lonely boy loves you

Ever since he broke your heart
You seem so lost
Each time you pass my way
Oh, how I long to take your hand
And say, don't cry
I'll kiss your tears away

Hey lonely girl
My only girl
Let me make your broken heart like new
Hey there lonely girl
Lonely girl
Don't you know this lonely boy loves you

You think that only his two lips 
Can kiss your lips
And make your heart stand still
But once you're in my arms you'll see
No one can kiss 
Your lips the way I will
The way I will

Hey there lonely girl
Lonely girl
Let me make your broken heart like new
Hey there lonely girl
Lonely girl
Don't you know this lonely boy loves you
Don't you know this lonely boy loves you
