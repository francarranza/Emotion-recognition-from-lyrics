Mother teach me to walk again...
Milk and honey so intoxicating...

I'm reunited
Into the fire
I am the spark
Into the fire
I yearn for comfort

Open the doors that lead on into eden...
Don't want no cheap disguise
I follow the signs marked back to the beginning...
No more compromise

And into the fire, I'm reunited!
Into the fire, I am the spark!
Into the night I yearn for comfort...

Ooh...! Free the water that carries me to the sea!
You I see as my security!

Into the fire, I'm reunited!
Into the fire, I am the spark!
Into the night I yearn for comfort...

I will stare at the sun until its light doesn't blind me
I will walk into the fire until its heat doesn't burn me
...And I will feed the fire...

Into the fire, I'm reunited!
Into the fire, I am the spark!
Into the night I yearn for comfort!
Into the fire, into the fire!

Into the fire, I'm reunited!
Into the fire, oh, I am the spark!
Into the night, I yearn for comfort!
Into the fire, into the fire!
