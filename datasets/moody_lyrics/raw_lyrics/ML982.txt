All the blank faces 
Walking around us
They mean nothing
Candles in the dark

Every speck of dust 
In this universe
Floating around us
Candles in the dark

All the blank faces 
Walking around us
They mean nothing
Candles in the dark

Every speck of dust 
In this universe, 
Floating around us
Candles in the dark

Every speck of dust 
In this universe, 
Floating around us
Candles in the dark

Every mistake I've made, 
I would make again
If that is what it took 
To be where I am
