"Fuck me? Fuck you, fuck you and this whole city and everyone in it."
Carved your name into my skin, in candlelight.
Sew it up with hate.
Carve, a message in my arm, in candlelight.
Sew it up with hate.

Found my misery, with a match and gasoline.
Burned alive, I'm a killing machine.
A whole life I'm silent.
Found my destiny, with a match and gasoline.
Liar's burn and scream, a whole life indebted to you.

The science of pain, insane I feel love.
Sick not to hurt, I want to watch the world burn.

Found my misery, with a match and gasoline.
Burned alive, I'm a killing machine.
A whole life I'm silent.
Found my destiny, with a match and gasoline.
Cobain can you hear me scream, a whole life indebted to you.

The science of pain, insane I feel love.
Sick not to hurt, I want to watch the world burn.
The science of pain, insane I feel love.
Sick not to hurt, I want to watch the world burn.

Carved your name into my skin, in candlelight.
Sew it up with hate.

The science of pain, insane I feel love.
Sick not to hurt, I want to watch the world burn.
The science of pain, insane I feel love.
Sick not to hurt, I want to watch the world burn.

Down! Down!
