This is a test, sugar, sugar, boo boo
This is just a test, tell me
What do you know about love
This is just a test, it ain't your life
Tell me

I'd like to give you a test
So darling, prepare yourself
When I say 'Love', please explain
What pictures pop in your brain

'Cause when you talk about love
Say when you think about love
When you talk about love
You should be talking 'bout me

Now if you need to be taught
Don't make me an after thought
For every lesson that's wrong
You can bet my good loving will be gone

So let's erase any doubt
Take a second or two to figure out
Speak from your lips to my ears
Yes, I know you know what I wanna hear

When you talk about love
When you think about love
When you talk about love
You should be talking 'bout me

No, I'm not gonna play tit for tat
When it comes to affairs of the heart
But if I love you, I want love back
And I know that I love you so just do your part

When you talk about love
I said, when you think about love
When you talk about love
You should be talking 'bout me

So when you talk about love
When you think about love
So when you talk about love
You should be talking 'bout me

I say, say my name, Patti, Patti, that's right
Say, say my name, Patti, Patti[Incomprehensible]
Say, say my name, Patti, Patti, what's my name?
My name is love, love, love

Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

My name is love, that's my name
You gotta talk about me

Say, when you talk about love
Say, when you think about love
Say, when you talk about love
You, should be talking 'bout love

Love, love, love, love
