I could take every fucking word she says
Throw it in her face
But would she even care
I still remember when she looked at me
That frown upon her face
Trying to be sincere
I gathered all those little things she said
Kept them close to me
Trying to make this real
This cloud will always hover over me
I'm leaving you today
'Cause now I see

Suffocate, you suffocate
You lie (I don't lie)
You're fake (I'm not a freak)
Suffocate, you suffocate
You always take (I don't take)
What you can (what I can)

I could take every fucking game you play
Blow it all away
But would you even care
I could take all those lies you said to me
Never go away
Never disappear
This cloud will always hover over me
I'm leaving you today
'Cause now I see

Suffocate, you suffocate
You lie (I don't lie)
You're fake (I'm not a freak)
Suffocate, you suffocate
You always take (I don't take)
What you can (what I can)

Suffocate, you suffocate
You lie (I don't lie)
You're fake (I'm not a freak)
Suffocate, you suffocate
You always take (I don't take)
What you can (what I can)

Now I'm far away from you (You're always far away)
I'll never bring back yesterday (bring back yesterday)
You're such a fake it's true
I can't believe the words you say
I'm far away from you
I'll never bring back yesterday

Suffocate, you suffocate
You lie (I don't lie)
You're fake (I'm not a freak)
Suffocate, you suffocate
You always take (I don't take)
What you can (what I can)

I always take
What I can
