Yummy, Yummy, Yummy
I got love in my tummy
And I feel like a-lovin' you
Love, you're such a sweet thing
Good enough to eat thing
And that's just a-what I'm gonna do
Ooh love, to hold ya
Ooh love, to kiss ya
Ooh love, I love it so
Ooh love, you're sweeter
Sweeter than sugar
Ooh love, I won't let you go

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy
I got love in my tummy
And as silly as it may seem
The lovin' that you re giving
Is what keeps me livin'
And your love is like
Peaches and cream
Kind-a like sugar
Kind-a like spices
Kind-a like, like what you do
Kind-a sounds funny
But love, honey
Honey I love you

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy
I got love in my tummy
That your love can satisfy
Love, you're such a sweet thing
Good enough to eat thing
And sweet thing, that ain't no lie
I love to hold ya
Oh love, to kiss ya
Ooh love, I love it so
Ooh love, you're sweeter
Sweeter than sugar
Ooh love, I won't let you go
