It's Christmas now
This is when we see all the angels
Dancing in the sky above, just for us
It's Christmas day
Something to believe in
I believe the love that we feel for each other
Is His gift to us
And nothing will keep us apart
If we love with a Christmas heart

It's Christmas now
This is when the eyes of our children
Search into these eyes of ours
How sweet they are
What kind of world are we gonna leave them?
What we couldn't learn from each other
We can learn from God
What a way to live, what a place to start
Bless us please with a Christmas heart
