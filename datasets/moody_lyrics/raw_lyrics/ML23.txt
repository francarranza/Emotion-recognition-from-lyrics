Where'd all the time go?
It's starting to fly.
See how the hands go;
Waving goodbye.

And you know I get so forgetful
When I look in your eyes.

Now she's walking backwards
Through a parade.
And I'm stuck in the shadow
Blocking the shade.

And there ain't no way to sweep up the mess that we've made
She gets dressed up like a pillow so she's always in bed

Flowers for the sick and dead
She's on the go, way too fast and way too slow
She'll turn to stone at hospitals and funeral homes
And when the fog rises somebody sighs who is not in disguise anymore

There's nothing to keep you
From falling in love.
It starts at the bottom
And comes from above.

Like pieces of a puzzle, like a hand in a glove
She gets dressed up like a pillow so she's always in bed

Flowers for the sick and dead
She's on the go, way too fast and way too slow
She'll turn and stop at hospitals and funeral homes
And when the tide rises somebody sinks and is gone in the blink of an eye
