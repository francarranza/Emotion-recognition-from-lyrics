Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky, stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together, keeps raining all the time

Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere, stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all the time

When she went away the blues walked in and they met me
If she stays away, that old rocking chair's gonna get me
All I do is pray the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on, everything I have is gone, stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all the time

Can't go on, everything I have is gone, stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time, the time
Keeps raining all the time
