Big, fat Santa's on his way
Big, fat Santa's on his way
Big, fat Santa's on his way tonight

You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
(Big, fat Santa's on his way)

He's making a list, he's checking it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
(Big, fat Santa's on his way)

He sees you when you're sleeping
(He is coming, he is coming)
He knows when you're awake
(He is coming, he is coming)

He knows when you've been bad or good
(He is coming, he is coming)
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
(Big, fat Santa's on his way, big, fat Santa's on his way
Big, fat Santa's on his way tonight)

The kids in girl and boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toy land
All around the Christmas tree

So, you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming
