There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be
To lived with you, to lived with you
There's a way
Everybody say's
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, I ain't got you

Baby, you don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody, to love somebody
The way I love you

In my mind
I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
I'm blind, so very blind
I'm a man
Can't you see what I am
I live and breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you, if I ain't got you, baby

You don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody, to love somebody
The way I love you

Oh yeah
You don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody, to love somebody, to love somebody
You don't know, to love somebody the way I love you
You don't know, you don't know
To love somebody, to love somebody, you don't know, ooh, ooh
To love somebody, to love somebody
The way I love you
