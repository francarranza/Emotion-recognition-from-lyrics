Well, she got back and up front
She's everything any country boy need, whoo
Inside is outside
And what you see is what she got up her sleeve, yeah

I'm talkin' tan leather and wild honey
Heavenly fields on a sunny day
All five senses, whoo, they're poppin' atcha
Now my little friend is comin' out to play

I just love, love, love that sexy little thing
I love, love, love, whoo, that sexy little thing

Well, I wanna roll all up in it
Get my sticky fingers all squeaky clean, whoo
It's stretched out and hardly fittin'
I got my buttons poppin' off my chest

I just love, love, love, whoo that sexy little thing, whoo
I love, love, love, that sexy little thing
Sexy little thing, well

She can drive, I get wasted
A stoner's dream on a Friday night, yeah
Whoo, jump on it

Jump on it
Uh huh
Come on, baby
Oh yeah, c'mon
Well, well, well, well, well

Love, love, love that sexy little thing
I love, love, love, whoo, that sexy little thing
Love, love, love, whoo, uh huh
Love, love, love, I love that sexy little thing
Sexy little thing, yeah

Come on, come on
Jump on it
She got it, she got it
