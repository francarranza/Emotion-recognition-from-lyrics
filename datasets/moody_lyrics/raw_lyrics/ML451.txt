Just the otha day
Said I ran into this beautiful lady
She asked me my name
And I told her it's Gyptian
Immeadiately she said
Boy I gotta give you sumtin' from her body
And I said Baby quickly
She said don't want you to tell nobody
Dat I gave it to you so easy
I said Wit me baby ya don't need to worry


She said Oh and Ah
She never felt so right
I said Yes my baby

You have become reality
Part of my subconsciousness
And my immortality
I'm the happiest man in the world
Because I have you for my girl
And I promise you my baby
I'm gonna take you on tours around the world
