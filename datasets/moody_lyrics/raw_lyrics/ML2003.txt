We were havin' such a good time, baby
Oh, yes, we were
Then you went and spoiled the whole thing, baby
In front of everyone

You're tellin' me I was wrong
And that all night long I was staring at someone else
Well, even if you were right
There's no need to fight, there's no need to get upset

Don't you get so mad about it (Do you have to get so mad)
Don't you get so mad about it (About it, about it)
Don't you get so mad about it (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Don't you get so mad about it, hey (Mad about it)

You should learn to control your feelings
Respectably
'Cause arguin' in public
Is embarrassin'

It's always the same thing, baby
Accusin' me out of jealousy
I never will understand
Why you make so much out such a little thing

Don't you get so mad about it (Do you have to get so mad)
Don't you get so mad about it (About it, about it)
Don't you get so mad about it (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Don't you get so mad about it, yeah

It's all so crazy now
Somehow it's got to change
Take a look at yourself
Carrying on this way

I know you care about
The love we're buildin' here
So why get all upset
It's just not worth it
Listen to me, my dear

Don't you get so mad about it (Do you have to get so mad)
Don't you get so mad about it (About it, about it)
Don't you get so mad about it (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Don't you get so mad about it, whoa (Mad about it), whoa, whoa, whoa

(Do you have to get so mad) Don't you get so mad, baby
(About it, about it) Whoa, whoa, ho, baby
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Don't you get so mad about it
(Mad about it) Whoa... ho... oh...

(Do you have to get so mad) Don't get so mad now, baby
(About it, about it) Ho, don't you get so mad about it, babe, don't you get so mad
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Don't you get so mad about it, babe, no
(Mad about it) Woo... ooh... ho

(Do you have to get so mad) Don't get so mad about it
(About it, about it) There's no need to get upset
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Darling, please don't forget the love we had
(Mad about it) Oh...
