Evil, runnin' through our brain,
We and evil is about the same.

Bad blood through our body flows,
Where's the love nobody knows.
(Nobody knows)
(Nobody knows)
(Nobody knows)

Beauty in our face you see,
Tryin' to hide all our misery,
(Our misery)
(Our misery)
(Our misery)

But evil, runnin' through our brain,
We and evil are about the same, oh yeah

Evil... in our life
Evil... causin' strife, yeah yeah
(Evil)

Lookin' for a place to guide
A little light in our souls and minds, oh yeah

Maybe if we learn to pray
Life would give us sunshiny days.
(Sunshiny days)
(Sunshiny days)
(Sunshiny days)

And evil, it's runnin' through our brains
Turn to love and won't be the blame.
(Won't be the blame)
(Won't be the blame)
(Won't be the blame)

Evil... in our life
Evil... causin' strife
(Evil)
