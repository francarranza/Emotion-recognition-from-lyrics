Gen'rals gathered in their masses,
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction,
Sorcerer of death's construction
In the fields the bodies burning,
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind,
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh Lord Yeah!

Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave peril to the poor, yeah

Time will tell on their empower minds,
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess,
Wait 'til their judgment day comes, yeah

Now in darkness world stops turning,
As you hear the bodies burning
No more War Pigs have the power,
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of judgment, God is calling
On their knees the War Pigs crawling,
Begging mercies for their sins
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings
Oh Lord Yeah!
