I keep hearing this medley in my ears
I keep feeling his presence so near
Music so sweet, so rich and complete (yeah yeah yeah)
Like the voice of an angel (yeah yeah yeah yeah oh)
It minsiter to me

A love song
Beautiful song
A love song
Sweet simple song

Could it be a dream or is it reality
Sounds just like a symphony
Music so sweet so rich and complete
Like the voice of an angel
It ministers to me

A love song
Beautiful Song
A Love Song
Sweet Simple Song

Guitar Plays (Instrumental)

The day he opened my eyes
And he changed my heart
Jesus is the love song, hes the love song
Love song
Too me!

Jesus is a love song, LOVE SONG
(Repeat x5)

Jesus is a love song.
