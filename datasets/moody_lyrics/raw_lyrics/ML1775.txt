Oh missing man where have you gone?
I miss you much, I miss you long
So many men, where did you go?
Overseas or under chairs?
Oh lover boy you're hiding out
Or could it be, I've passed you by
A thousand times before, not knowing who you were

My love will come, my love will come, my love
For you I wait, for you I wait, my love
My love it burns, my love it burns, my love
My love will come, my love will come, my love

Oh solitude I'm doing fine
I dance alone with my head high
Oh solitude it's all sublime
To swing alone the choice is mine
To wait while others play,
To let my lover wait

My love will come, my love will come, my love
For you I sing, for you I sing, my love
My love it burns, my love it burns, my love
My love will come, my love will come, my love

My love will come, my love will come, my love
For you I wait (sing), for you I wait (sing), my love
My love it burns, my love it burns, my love
My love will come, my love will come, my love

My love will come, my love will come, my love
My love will come, my love will come, my love
My love will come, my love will come, my love
My love will come, my love will come, my love
My love will come, my love will come, my love
My love will come, my love will come, my love
