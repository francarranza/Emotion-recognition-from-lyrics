Somewhere south of the border
Headin' for a doll serenade
Taking more than we aughta'
Shakin' off the masquerade

Lonely, she decided to see ya'
Get enough for her on the side
When the heat arrived at the motel
Whole town stayed inside

Some lie for love
Some lie for fame
Some lie for trust
Some lie in vain

Some lie for love
Some lie for gain
But I lie for you
In the pouring rain

Move on up to the Bayou
With the same old set of rules
You get nothin' for nothin'
And that's a fact
When you're tied to the ship of fools

Alice looking over her shoulder
Like a Chinese diplomat
Daring anyone to hold her
With a smile like a Cheshire cat

Some lie for love
Some lie for fame
Some lie for trust
Some lie in vain

Some lie for love
Some lie for gain
But I lie for you
In the pouring rain

Shakin' to a halt on a Voodoo
Second oldest trick in the book
No one does it quite like you do
When you start you can never
Stop... never stop

On my way to a seance
Met a gypsy renegade
Crossed my palm with silver
In my heart put a jagged stake

Some lie for love
Some lie for fame
Some lie for trust
Some lie in vain

Some lie for love
Some lie for gain
But I lie for you
In the pouring rain
