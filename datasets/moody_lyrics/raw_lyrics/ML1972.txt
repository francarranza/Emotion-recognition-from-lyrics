When the world is ready to fall
On your little shoulders
And when you're feeling lonely and small
You need somebody there to hold you
You can call out my name
When you're only lonely
Now don't you ever be ashamed,
You're only lonely
When you need someone around
On the nights that try you
I was there when you were a Queen
And I'll be the last one there beside you
So you can call out me name,
When you're only lonely,
No don't you ever be ashamed,
You're only lonely


Oh...
When the world is ready to fall
On your little shoulders
And when you're feeling lonely and small
You need somebody there to hold you
You can call out my name
When you're only lonely
It's no crime, Darlin', we've got lots of time
Wooow... ooh...
Babe, there's nothing wrong with you,
Darlin' I get lonely too
You're only lonely (only lonely)
So if you need me
All you gotta do is call me
Please call on me...
You're only lonely
