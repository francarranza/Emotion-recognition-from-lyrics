Can you hear it calling?
Hijack what you're wanting
A sweet ride baby
With a broken face

Stop, look, dig it
If she wanna get it
Stop, look, dig it
All she can destroy

Child afraid to use it
Strip it and abuse it
A sweet ride, baby
Get me out of this place

Stop, look, dig it
If she wanna get it
Stop, look, dig it
All she can destroy

If she wanna get it
Stop, look, dig it

Miracles a-losing
A cash in, baby
