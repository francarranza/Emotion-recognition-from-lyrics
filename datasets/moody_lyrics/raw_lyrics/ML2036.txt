Seven days a week
Ev'ry week of the month
And ev'ry month of the year
He's got us making presents
And I'm happy

Ev'ry girl and boy
Gets their own kind of toy
We like to fill 'em with joy
We're workin' over time
To make 'em happy

Then on Christmas eve
We jump on big red's sleigh
We don't miss a chimney
On our jolly way

We won't stop until
Every kid gets a fill
Of Santa's brand of good will
The thrill of spilling cheer
Just makes us happy

So, if you've been good yourself
You might see the happy elf
Stop by your house and make
You very happy

The happy elf
I'm the happy elf
I'm the happy elf and I just might stop on by
The happy elf
I'm the happy elf
I'm the happy elf and I just might stop on by
I'm Santa's spy!
