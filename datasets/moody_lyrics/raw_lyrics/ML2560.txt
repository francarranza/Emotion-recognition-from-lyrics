Again we stalk the stage
At mach speed we engage
Feeding people's rage
The big cat's left its cage
Back in the bus again
To catch another plane
This behavior's quite insane
But we do it for the fame, yeah

I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road

The road will never end
It always starts again
Another show's around the bend
Another long lost friend
Faceless as the snow
There's nothing special about the road
It's just another haul
It's just too damn long that's all, yeah

I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road

I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
