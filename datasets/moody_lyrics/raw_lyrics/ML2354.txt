Everything I do makes her sad
If I say I love her then it just makes her mad
Nothing I can do will make her love me too
Everything I do makes her sad

Everything I do makes her cry oh my
It just breaks my heart in two when I hear her sigh
There is nothing worse than to know she hurts
Everything I do makes her cry

Call it love
Call it pain
Call it all insane

Love is blind
Love is cruel
Love is fine for fools

Everything I do makes her sad
I could understand it if I treated her bad
But I remind her of some unhappy love
Can't replace the love that she had
So everything I do everything I do
Everything I do makes her sad
