Late one night, I heard a knock on my door
To no surprise, it was my landlord
He notified me I was late with the rent
What can ya do with your last dollar spent?

Ya got trouble, some kind of trouble

I called up my baby for a little advice
Because my sugar baby always treats me so nice
I had a funny feeling he wasn't alone
When I heard another voice whisper, "Hang up the phone"

I got trouble, some kind of trouble

Trouble in my heart, trouble on my mind, never any trouble for me to find some kind of trouble

I went to my boss, said I need a little time
To work on this poor broken heart of mine
He said I'd like to help ya; I've been there before, but the problem is, girl
Ya don't work here no more

Ya got trouble, some kind of trouble

Trouble in my heart, trouble on my mind, never any trouble for me to find some kind of trouble

I Got trouble

Well I was down around as low as a body can be
So I talked to my preacher about praying for me
He smiled and he said, "Child, you're not alone
Because all God's children got to deal with their own trouble"

Some kind of trouble

Trouble in my heart, trouble on my mind, never any trouble for me to find some kind of trouble

Some kind of trouble

Some kind of trouble

Trouble in my heart, trouble on my mind, never any trouble for me to find some kind of trouble

Trouble
