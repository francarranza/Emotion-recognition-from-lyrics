It would be like the sky that's never sunny
It would be like the bee that can't make honey
Or maybe like the fallin' snow that never melts
Like always hearing of your touch but never felt
It's like the vase that holds no flowers

Never wanna sleep without you
Never wanna wake without you
I never wanna part with life abundantly

Never take a chance without you
(Cause) I'll never do my best without you
I never wanna leave this life abundantly

Hallelujah

It would be like the game that has no end
Like knowing loves behind the door you cannot enter
Like knowing joys in a mornin that never comes
(Kinda like) What life would be if God didn't send his son
It's kinda like a heart with no love flowing through it

(I) Never wanna sleep without you
(And I) Never wanna wake without you
(No) I never wanna part with life abundantly

Never take a chance without you
(Cause) I never do my best without you
(Oh Father) I never wanna leave this life abundantly

Never wanna sleep without you
Never wanna wake without you
I never wanna part with life abundantly

Never take a chance without you
(Cause) I never do my best without you
I never wanna leave this life abundantly

Since you came in my life your source of my abundant living
