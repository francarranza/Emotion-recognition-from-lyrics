Down by the riverside,
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside
I'm gonna lay down my burden,
Down by the riverside,

Well, I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield,
(Where?) down by the riverside
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside
I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield,
(A-ha) down by the riverside
I'm gonna study war no more
