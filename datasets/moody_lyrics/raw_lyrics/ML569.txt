Blue you radiant blue
I don't know how you can stand next to me
You you talk like a noose
And only confuse my perplexity
Now that I'm so sad and not quite right
I could dance all night
I could dance all night

Shake your rattle-snake skin
And become a part of society
Wait on down the highway
To see how far I'll come a-run a-run
Run running
All that we had salvaged from the fire
Was a waste of time
What a waste of time

Should I trust all the rust that's on TV
I guess with some distaste I disagree
With quite a fashionable dispassion for
The dispossessed under-stressed
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
And I don't care if you don't like it
Or just don't see

Well now that we fattened the cow
And set out to plow unknown enemies
"Wow!" shouts the startled crowd
"How now did you see what I did see?"
The ravaged cabbage drifts on dark red skies
And it looks so nice
Gee it looks so nice

Shout just let it on out
Confusion becomes a philosophy
Down we're reaching the town where we
Don't have to stand around and look
Over our shoulders
Oh hell I never knew was what we made it
Let's just take it slow in this home on ice

In this home on ice
In this home on ice
In this home on ice
