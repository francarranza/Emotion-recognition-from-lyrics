Don't look back, it won't do any good
Don't look ahead you'll just be misunderstood
Everything you need could be right in front of you
It doesn't take much to see what is true
They say we are going to die if we go on like this
Who do you believe? Every story has a twist
Take a look around, tell me what you see
People in the world just trying to be free
What about all those things you could have done but you don't?
They say things happen for a reason, you don't do them, they won't

I'm looking for life, love and laughter

Everything in between and what happens after
I'm looking for life, lookin' for love, lookin' for laughter

Things are gunna change, they never stay the same
That's why we're fighting a war but the people are to blame
You can only stand up for what you believe
Don't be blinded by the power of greed
What about all those things you could have done but you don't?
They say things happen for a reason, you don't do them, they won't

I'm looking for life, love and laughter
Everything in between and what happens after
I'm looking for life, love and laughter
Everything in between and what happens after
Looking for laughter

We got everything we need
All the money in the world, want to buy what we see
Dreams are worth more than gold
Some people hold on, some people let go
The stars all come out at night
The velvet sky, all so bright
I feel so close to you
Because I see what you see too

I'm looking for life, love and laughter
Everything in between and what happens after
Looking for life
I'm looking for life, love and laughter
Everything in between and what happens after
What happens after!
I'm looking for life, love and laughter
Everything in between and what happens after
What happens after?
