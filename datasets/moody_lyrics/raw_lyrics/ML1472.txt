When by the phone
In vain you sit
You very soon in your mind realize that it's not just
An ordinary pain in your heart

When you by chance
Go knock on her door
Walkin' away you're convinced that it's much more
Than just an ordinary pain in your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain in your heart

Don't fool yourself
Tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart

When you catch up
But she says goodbye
Hold back your tears and before you start to cry
Say you feel unnecessary pain in your heart

Tell her you're glad
It's over in fact
Can she take with her the pain she brought you back
Takin' that ordinary pain from your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain from your heart

Don't fool yourself
Tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart

You're just a masochistic fool
Because you knew my love was cruel
You never listened when they said
Don't let that girl go to your head

But like a play boy you said no
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
This little girl mind you will blow
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
But then it blew you out the box
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
When I put my stuff on key and lock
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
It makes me feel kind of sick
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
To know love put you in a trick
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
I knew our love would have to end
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
The day I made it with your friend
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
Giving your love to one unreal
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
Like a big fool I know you feel
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
But in this lovie-dovie game
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
With all its joy there must be pain
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
But now the time has surely come
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
This game don't seem like so much fun
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
You're crying big crocodile tears
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
Don't match the ones I've cried for years
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
When I was home waiting for you
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
You were out somewhere doing the do
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
You know I'd really like to stay
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
But like you did I've got to play
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
You're dumb to think I'd let you be
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
Scott free without some pain from me
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
I heard your song and took a chance
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
But to your music I can't dance
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
Go tell your story 'sob-sad'
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
About you blowing what you had
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
Since one ain't good enough for you
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
Then do yourself see how you do
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain

Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
