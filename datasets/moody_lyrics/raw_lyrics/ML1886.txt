Well I was walking through the middle of town
And I said to myself, "What's going on?"
People breaking the law just to make ends meet
People breaking their hearts just to stay off the street
And written on the wall for everyone to see
Was "Love is the law" right there on the street
It said
Love is the, love is the
Love is the, love is the
Love is the, love is the law
Oh,
Love love love
Love, love is the law
Well girls, yeah you're looking alright
And boys, you don't look so bad
You gotta give it, if you want to get it
You gotta give it, if you want to get it
Love is the, love is the
Love is the, love is the
Love is the, love is the law
