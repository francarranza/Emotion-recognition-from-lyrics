Butterflies before they fly
They never doubt the beauty that awaits inside
Like a flower reaching out, reaching for the sun
They don't compare theirselves to anyone
And I wonder why we do

So don't try too hard now, be who you are now
You've got to let it shine
Beauty has no face, no color, no race child
Beauty is inside

In your eyes, I see your light
Shining from your heart when you don't even try
So just be yourself 'cause there's no one else
No one else like you, there ain't nobody in this world it's true
So let your light come through

So don't try too hard now, be who you are now
You've got to let it shine
Beauty has no face, no color, no race child
Beauty is inside
Beauty is inside

There's more than what meets the eye
Much more than on the outside
It's something that's deep inside
You won't find it on a movie screen or pages of a magazine
Much more than the eye can see

Don't try too hard now, be who you are now
You've got to let it shine
Beauty has no face, no color, no race child
Beauty is inside

Don't try too hard now, be who you are now
You've got to let it shine
Beauty has no face, no color, no race child
Beauty is inside

Don't try too hard now, be who you are now
You've got to let it shine
Beauty has no face, no color, no race child
Beauty is inside

Don't try too hard now, be who you are now
You've got to let it shine
Beauty has no face, no color, no race child
Beauty is inside
