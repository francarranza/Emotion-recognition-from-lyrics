The quiet kid has come to stay
What do you say?
He says I'm lonely, says I'm lonely

I'll tell you everything I know
What do you know?
He says I'm hopeless, says I'm hopeless

And that's why I can't send you Christmas cards
It's why I had to keep you in the dark
Less big words and more exclamation marks

The little king is locked away (locked away!)
Swallow the key
He says he's all right, but not sorry

I'll tell you everything I saw (what do you see?)
A hundred and one
He says it's all right, but I know what I've done

And that's why I can't send you Christmas cards
It's why I had to keep you in the dark
Less big words and so ...

Charmed but destroyed
Opens up the window
Bored and overwhelmed
Always overwhelmed
But that's the best part, that's the best part

'Cause I've been taking your advice
Like a Speak and Spell
But I could get to know you better
And never know you well

And that's why I can't send you Christmas cards
It's why I had to keep you in the dark
Less big words and so ...

Charmed but destroyed
Opens up the window
Bored and overwhelmed
Always overwhelmed
But that's the best part, that's the best part
