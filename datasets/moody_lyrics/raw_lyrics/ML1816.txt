C'mon say you love me
C'mon say you care
I see your face in my mind
I see it everywhere

I will be your girl
I will be your girl

First say I'll go
But I must be wrong
Your make-up's on another
But never follow

I will be your girl
I will be your girl

You can have my word
You can have my word
You can have my word
I will be your girl

Each day you waste
On somebody else
And it's so hard to find
And I'm your kind, I'm your kind

I will be your girl
I will be your girl

You can have my word
You can have my word
You can have my word
I will be your girl

Your girl, your girl, your girl
Your girl, your girl, your girl
Your girl, your girl.
