It's gonna take a lotta love 
To change the way things are
It's gonna take a lotta love 
Or we won't get too far

So if you look in my direction
And we don't see eye to eye
My heart needs protection, and so do I

It's gonna take a lotta love 
To get us through the night 
It's gonna take a lotta love 
To make this work out right 

So if you are out there waiting
I hope you show up soon 
You know I need relating, not solitude

Gotta lotta love
Gotta lotta love

It's gonna take a lotta love (Gonna take a lotta love)
To change the way things are
It's gonna take a lotta love (Gonna take a lotta love)
Or we won't get too far

It's gonna take a lotta love (Gonna take a lotta love)

It's gonna take a lotta love (Gonna take a lotta love)

It's gonna take a lotta love (Gonna take a lotta love)

It's gonna take a lotta love (Gonna take a lotta love)
