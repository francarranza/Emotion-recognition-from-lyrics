Some see life as a broken promise
Some see life as an endless fight
They think they live in the age of darkness
They think they live in the age of light.

It's a angry world
And everything is gonna be alright
Yeah, it's a angry world
Yeah, it's a angry world.

Some see life as hope eternal
Some see life as a business plan
Some wish some would go to hells inferno
For screwing with their life in freedom land.

It's a angry world
For the business man and the fisherman
It's a angry world
And no doubt everything will go as planned, yeah.

Yeah, it's a angry world
Yeah, it's a angry world.

Yeah.
