I've been loving you too long to stop now
There were time and you want to be free
My love is growing stronger, as you become a haven to me
Oh I've been loving you a little too long
I don't wanna stop now, oh
With you my life
Has been so wonderful
I can't stop now

There were times and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger as our affair grows old
I've been loving you a little too long, long
I don't want to stop now
Oh, oh, oh
I've been loving you a little bit too long
I don't wanna stop now
No, no, no

Don't make me stop now
No baby
I'm down on my knees
Please, don't make me stop now
I love you, I love you
I love you with all of my heart
And I can't stop now
Don't make me stop now

Please, please don't make me stop now
Good god of mineI love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you in so many different ways
I love you in so many different ways
