Searching for home
Left all alone
Lifes on a stroll
Love comes and go's
When will it end
Nobody knows, I chose my road
I know I'm a long way from home

Searching for home

Maybe I'm wrong
I know what I feel
Somewhere its out there
In it I'm real
But when will it end
Nobody knows, I chose my road
I know I'm a long way from home

Searching for home
My home
Searching for home

And you said the journeys just footsteps home
In my head, Ill never be alone
And you said my life will tell a story
But I'm still none the wiser, and I can't understand

Searching for home
Left all alone
I chose my road
I know I'm a long way from home
Searching for home
My home
I'm all alone
Searching for home
