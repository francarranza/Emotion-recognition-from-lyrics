Problems when I wanna see you everyone I knew
Uncle lied and I could die and I said something new
Would you like the things I saw and bring you too
I should tell me more I'd like to see me I know where I would

Ooh

I went down my war I shoots and I take everyone
Parties like my policy and I take where I'm some
Damaged like my every thoughts and when you talk I do
Things I did when I was dead and everyone loves you

Ooh
