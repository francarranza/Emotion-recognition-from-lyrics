Covered in sinners and dripping with guilt
Making you money from slime and from filth.
Parading your bellies in ivory towers
Investing our lives in your schemes and your powers.

You got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head.
You've got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief in your head.

Be quick or be dead - Be quick (quick, quick) or be dead (dead, dead, dead)
See... what's ruling all our lives
See... who's pulling strings
See... what's ruling all our lives
See who pull the strings
I bet you won't fall on your face
Your belly will hold you in place.

The serpent is crawling inside of your ear
He says you must vote for what you want to hear.
Don't matter what's wrong as long as you're all right
So pull yourself, stupid, rob yourself blind.

You got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief in your head.
You've got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head.

Be quick or be dead - Be quick (quick, quick) or be dead (dead, dead, dead)

You got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head.
You've got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head.

Be quick or be dead - Be quick!
