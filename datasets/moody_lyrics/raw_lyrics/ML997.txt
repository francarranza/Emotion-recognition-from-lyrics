Oh, you're such a pretty thing 
I'll take you and I'll make you 
All mine 
I would steal you 
From this patient world 
Let it chase us 
It could never take you back 
  
We could watch it from the clouds 
We can't stop it anyhow 
It's not ours 
  
We could watch it from the clouds 
We can't stop it anyhow 
It's not ours 
It's not ours 
  
I know you know me well enough 
To know I'm lucky to have you 
  
But oh it's just the little things 
The words that I should tell you 
All the time 
Like you're so sweet to me 
When you beat me 
In double solitaire 
You're so sweet to me 
In a world that's not always fair 
  
We could watch it from the clouds 
We can't stop it anyhow 
It's not ours 
  
We could watch it from the clouds 
We can't stop it anyhow 
It's not ours 
  
The more love that you feel 
The more your little heart will ache 
Love is the only thing that carries on 
It's the only thing this world can't take 
This love is ours 
This love is ours 
  
Oh you're such a pretty thing 
I'll take you and I'll make you 
All mine
