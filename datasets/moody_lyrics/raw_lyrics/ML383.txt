I don't feel the way I've ever felt
I know, gonna smile and not get worried
I try but it shows, anyone can make what I have built
And better now, anyone can find the same white pills

It takes my pain away
It's a lie
A kiss with open eyes
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me

It takes my pain away
Never mind
These are horrid times
Oh oh oh
I can't let it bother me

I never thought I'd walk away from you
I did, but it's a false sense of accomplishment
Every time I quit, anyone can see my every flaw
It isn't hard, anyone can say they're above this all

It takes my pain away
It's a lie
A kiss with open eyes
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me

It takes my pain away
Never mind
These are horrid times
Oh oh oh
I can't let it bother me

I can't let it bother me

It takes my pain away
It's a lie
A kiss with open eyes
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me

It takes my pain away
Never mind
These are horrid times
Oh oh oh
I can't let it bother me

It takes my pain
It takes my pain
It takes my pain
It takes my pain away
