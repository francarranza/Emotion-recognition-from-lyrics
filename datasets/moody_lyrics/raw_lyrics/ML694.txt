Boogie fever
Got to boogie down
Boogie fever
I think it's going around

I took my baby to the drive-in show
She turned the speaker down
And then she turned on the radio
I watched a silent movie, digging funky sound

She's got the boogie fever
She likes to boogie down
Boogie fever
I think it's going around

I took my baby to the pizza parlor (pizza parlor)
To get a bite to eat, now, now, yeah
I put some money in the jukebox for her
You know she ate her pizza dancing to the beat

She's got the boogie fever
She likes to boogie down
Uh-uh-huh, she's got the boogie fever
I think it's going around

(All night long we did the bump, bump, bump)
Yes we did, yes we did, yes we did, yeah
(We kept it going strong, doing the bump, bump, bump)
Doing the bump, bump, bump, yeah

I called the doctor on the telephone (doctor, doctor)
Said doctor, doctor, please, I, I, I
I got this feeling, rocking and a-reeling
Tell me, what can it be, is it some new disease

They call it boogie fever
You got to boogie down, uh-huh-huh, just get on down
Boogie fever
I think it's going around

(Fever)
(Fever)
(Fever)
(Oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-ooh)

(All night long, we did the bump, bump, bump)
Yes we did, yes we did, yes we did
(We kept it going strong, doing the bump, bump, bump, yeah)

Everybody's got the boogie fever (boogie fever, baby)
Boogie down, let’s get on down, let’s get on down
Boogie fever (boo-boo-boo-boogie fever)
I think it's going around and around and around

I (I) got the boogie fever
You (you) got the boogie fever
She (she’s) got the boogie fever
Everybody's got the boogie fever

Boogie fever
Boogie down (just get on down, just get on down)
Boogie fever (boo-boo-boo-boogie fever)
I think it's going around
