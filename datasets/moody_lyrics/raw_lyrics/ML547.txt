Love is the key to life
The thing that makes it right
Why we can't be one I'll never know
Love is the key this time
And there's know doubt in my mind
If you really want to be free
Love is the key

Love is the key that's so real
It's the kind of thing you can feel
We can make things nice If we let it be
Love is the key you know I'm right
Oh it makes you feel so dynamite

If you really want to be free
You can believe that love is the key

Love is the key to life
The thing that makes it right
Why we can't be one I'll never know
Love is the key you know I'm right
Oh it makes you feel so dynamite

If you really want to be free
You can believe that love is the key
If you really want to be free
You can believe that love is the key
