Hey you
The long time stranger
Do you think of before?
When we were wrapped up in ourselves
In a mess behind the door
Now it seems so, so immature
Your stolen signs
The stickers on your door

The beginning was warmer
Than your ending prose
You were another conqueror
I was another part disposed
I guess that's just the way it goes

Hey you
My one time wonderer
Do you feel for before?
It is etched out in photographs
And scratched up records
Now it seems so, so immature
Your postered walls
The dirt on your floor

The beginning was warmer
Than your ending prose
You were another conqueror
I was another part disposed
I guess that's just the way it goes

So I want to know
Did you ever think of me on a summer day?

Or holding her hand out in tha rain?
Remember I said 'Please, please, please don't go'
And now we're just strangers in different worlds
I guess that's just the way it goes
Well I guess that's just the way it goes
