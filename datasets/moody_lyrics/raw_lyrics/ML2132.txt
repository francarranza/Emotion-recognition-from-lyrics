This is my right
A right given by god
To live a free life
To live in freedom

Talkin' about freedom
I'm talkin' about freedom
I will fight for the right
To live in freedom

Any one
Tries to take it away
You'll have to answer
Cause this is my right

I'm talkin' about freedom
I'm talkin' about freedom
I will fight for the right
To live in freedom

Yeah Oh

I'm' talkin' about freedom
I'm talking about freedom
I will fight for the right
To live in freedom

Everybody talkin' about freedom
We're talkin' about freedom
We will fight for the right
To live in freedom

Oh

Talkin' about freedom
I'm talkin' about freedom
I will fight for the right
To live in freedom

I'm' talkin' about freedom
I'm' talkin' about freedom
We will fight for the right
To live in freedom
