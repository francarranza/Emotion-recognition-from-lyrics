Her look is evil satisfaction
She likes to see me on my knees
Yeah, but just to touch the main attraction
Well, I can put up with the tease

I don't need love
You know what I'm thinkin' of
I can't get enough, no
I don't need love

Uh!

There's something crazy goin' down here
She's tryin' to save it, now you can bet
I never had my hands and face so full of love
And never got to get wet, no

I don't need love
You know what I'm thinkin' of
I can't get enough
I don't need love

I don't really know what love is
Hey, I'm just lookin' for some sex, yeah

I don't need love
You know what I'm thinkin' of
I can't get enough, no
I don't need love

You know what I'm thinkin' of
I can't get enough
I don't need love
I don't need love
