Winter nights, twinkling lights
And snowflakes falling to the ground
The air is filled with Christmas

Santa’s sleigh, kids at play
It’s that magic time of year
When love is all around us

And that magic
Seems to reach right out and touch me again
Just like the years before
It’s Christmas in my heart

It seems that time stands still for Christmas
It’s time for laughter and cheer
A time for giving to others
And sharing our love for those we hold so dear

Too soon the season’s over
As I face the New Year
This wish I make oh yeah
At every start, may it be Christmas
Always Christmas in my heart

It seems that time stands still for Christmas
It’s time for laughter and cheer
A time for giving to others
And sharing our love with those we hold so dear

Too soon the season’s over
And as I face the New Year
This wish I make on every start
May it be Christmas
Always Christmas in my heart

Oh, Oh
It’s just Christmas in my heart
Have a good time
