You're a big girl now

No more daddy's little girl (Oh, ho, ho, ho)

You're a big girl now

No more daddy's little girl (Oh, ho, ho, ho)

No more pigtails in your hair

No more silly looks with a childish glare

No more doll for you to play

No more dumbness in the things you say

You're a big girl now

No more daddy's little girl (Oh, ho, ho, ho)

You're a big girl now

No more daddy's little girl (Oh, ho, ho, ho)

You can love, girl, if you must

You can kiss, girl, if you must

What you'll see day by day

All the realness in your way

And you're a big girl now

No more daddy's little girl (Oh, ho, ho, ho)

You're a big girl now

No more daddy's little girl (Oh, ho, ho, ho)

{Baby, I love you} Baby, I love you

{Yes, I do} Oh, yes, I do now

{In all my life} In all my life

{You're my dream come true} You're my dream come true

{You're a big girl now} You're a big girl now

{Yes, you are}

{You're my happiness} Shining star

You're a big girl now

No more daddy's little girl (Oh, ho, ho, ho) You're a big girl now
