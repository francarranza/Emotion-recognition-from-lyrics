She could have had them all
Wasn't I too tame for her
That meteor?
But I was the one she came for

I was all smoke and haze
And then a flame for her
That hurricane
Hurricane, when she came for me
Hurricane, when she came

She had power, she had soul
And things they don't have a name for
I had to ask myself
Was I game for her?

I thought that I was through
She thought that wasn't true
Oh, she had things to do
I was the one she came for
Hurricane, when she came

She saw me on the fly
She knew me with one eye
I walked her 'round the block
And nothing's been the same for me

I thought I'd seen a lot
She proved that I had not
And I needed what she brought
And it was a hurricane when she came for me
A hurricane when she came

I was the one she came for
Hurricane, when she came

Hurricane, when she, hurricane, when she
Hurricane when she came for me
I was the one she, I was the one she
I was the one she came for, yeah
