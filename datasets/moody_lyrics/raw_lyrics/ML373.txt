Oh, nobody's fault but mine
A-nobody's fault but mine, yeah
Trying to save my soul to light
Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine

Devil he told me to roll
Devil he told me to roll, roll, roll, roll
How to roll the log tonight
Nobody's fault but mine

Brother he showed me the gong
Brother he showed me the ding dong ding dong
How to kick that gong to life
Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine

Got a monkey on my back
A m-m-m-m-monkey on my back back back back
Gonna change my ways tonight
Nobody's fault but mine

I will get down rollin' tonight
N-n-n-nobody's fault...
