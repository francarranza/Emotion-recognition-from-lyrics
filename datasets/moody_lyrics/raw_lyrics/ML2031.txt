Oh, yeah, don't think about it, don't think about it
Yeah, don't think about it, don't think about it

Honey, it's cold outside
Pour another glass of wine, light up the fireplace
The holiday starts right now
Make yourself slow down, put on a happy face

I don't want you to buy me nothin', it's alright
Love's the only thing on my list
All I want is a kiss for Christmas
Honey, won't you give me a kiss for Christmas? Darlin'

Early on Christmas day
Everyone looks for love under the Christmas tree
And though you might think it's strange
I wanna tell you, my love, don't buy a thing for me

I don't want you to get me nothin', it's alright
'Cause if I could just get my wish
All I want is a kiss for Christmas
Honey, won't you give me a kiss for Christmas? Darlin'

A kiss for Christmas is all that I want yeah
A kiss for Christmas, don't make me wait for love
This Christmas all that I want is
A kiss for Christmas, don't make me wait, love

Don't make me wait, baby, Merry Christmas, yeah
Come on, yeah, don't think about it, don't think about it

All I want is a kiss for Christmas
Honey, won't you give me a kiss for Christmas? Darlin'
All I want is a kiss for Christmas

Honey, won't you give me a kiss for Christmas? Darlin'
All I want is a kiss for Christmas
Honey, won't you give me a kiss for Christmas?


Oh, yeah, don't think about it, don't think about it
Yeah, don't think about it, don't think about it
