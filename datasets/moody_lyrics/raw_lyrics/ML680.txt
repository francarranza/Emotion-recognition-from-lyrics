Yesterday the sky was cold and grey
Kept me as a prisoner in my home
Ground through my door when I was all alone
Scowled down on me laughed with the Sun
As he hid himself from darkness from everyone

The sky sometimes, so unkind, first he rains and then he shines
When he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place
When he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place
I will love you till the sky above you, shatters over you and me
And lays us down to sleep forever, la-la-la-la

The sky today was brilliant and blue
Brightened up the walkway to my door
Brought you as a sunbeam on my floor
Beamed you down on me from the other side
Brought you up to me across the ocean wide

The sky sometimes so unkind then again he's my best friend
When he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place
When he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place
I will love you till the sky above you, shatters over you and me
And lays us down to sleep forever, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Sleep forever, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Sleep forever, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
