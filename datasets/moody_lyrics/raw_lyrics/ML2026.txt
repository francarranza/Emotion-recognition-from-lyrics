There's a Christmas tree
In a window frame
Just inside my door
But my Christmas tree
Doesn't look the same
As it always has before

There's just one lonely present
Beneath my Christmas tree
'Cause the best little present
A girl ever had
Has gone away from me

Oh, my Christmas tree is not very big
In fact it's kind of small
Honey went, he picked 'em out
They always seem so tall

The lights don't seem so bright this year
It's hard for me to see
The smile that made my Christmas bright
Is gone away from me

I have been so lonely
Since you left me all alone
All I want for Christmas is
My baby back at home

Oh, my Christmas tree's so sad and bare
My room's so big and cold
They wish me happy new year
But the new year is already on

There's no little angel
On top where it used to be
'Cause the angel
That made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me...
'Cause the angel
That made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me...
'Cause the angel
That made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me...
