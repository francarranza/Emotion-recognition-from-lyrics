Boy meets girl
You were my dream, my world
But I was blind
You cheated on me from behind

So on my own
I feel so all alone
Though I know it's true
I'm still in love with you

I need a miracle, I wanna be your girl
Give me a chance to see that you are made for me
I need a miracle, please, let me be your girl
One day you'll see it can happen to me

I need a miracle, I wanna be your girl
Give me a chance to see that you are made for me
I need a miracle, please, let me be your girl
One day you'll see it can happen to me, it can happen to me

Miracle

Day and night
I'm always by your side
'Cause I know for sure
My love is real, my feelings pure

So take a try
No need to ask me why
'Cause I know it's true
I'm still in love with you

I need a miracle, I wanna be your girl
Give me a chance to see that you are made for me
I need a miracle, please, let me be your girl
One day you'll see it can happen to me

I need a miracle, I wanna be your girl
Give me a chance to see that you are made for me
I need a miracle, please, let me be your girl
One day you'll see it can happen to me, it can happen to me

Miracle
