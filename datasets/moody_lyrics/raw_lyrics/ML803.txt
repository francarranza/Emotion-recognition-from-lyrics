The show is over, party's just begun
I'm high tonight, lookin' for some fun
Raging metal, with spikes and chains
And all the women, on my brain

I'm a skull splitter
Till the brink of dawn
Drank too many
Thousands on the lawn
I'm a skull splitter
Thrashing till the end
Drank too many

Kickin' ass, 'cause it feels great
I'm trouble walkin', can't stand straight

Up at dawn, the rising dead
We're conquering, in Balingen
Raging metal with spikes
And chains
And all the women,
On my brain

I'm a skull splitter
I'm a skull splitter
I'm a skull splitter
I'm a skull splitter
