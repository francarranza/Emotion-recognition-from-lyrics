One time is all I need
To know my job's complete
And when I reach into
Myself, my past comes true

One time is all I need
To know my job's complete
And when I reach into
Myself, my past comes true

My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life, my life

One time is all I need
To know my job's complete
And when I reach into
Myself, myself comes true

My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life, my life

I don't got time
I don't got nothing left for you
I don't got time
I don't got nothing left for you
