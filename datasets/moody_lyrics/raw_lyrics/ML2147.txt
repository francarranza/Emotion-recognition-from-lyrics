Faster, louder, my love for you
Bigger, bolder, my love for you
There's no sense for you to make this ******
I simply hate every minute that we're apart

Taller, stronger, my love for you
Whiter, brighter, my love for you
There's no point for you to sound smart
I simply hate every minute that we're apart

Hotter, wetter
Larger, longer
No no no there's no sense for you to make this *****
I simply hate every minute that we're apart
