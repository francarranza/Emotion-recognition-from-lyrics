I Won't Be Home Tonight

Do you think I'd come runnin' at the drop of a hat?
Oh baby don't you know me any better than that?
You're hot one minute, and gone the next
So tell me what do you expect?

You're standin' there tellin' me you're home for good
Did you think I'd believe it? did you think I would?
You can turn it right around, where you come from
'Cause you and me are over and done

I won't be home tonight.
I'll get along just fine without you
Don't bother callin' me tonight
Oh baby take it somewhere else

Take it somewhere else

Oh you think it's so easy, all you ever gotta do
To make every man roll over for you
You tell 'em something nice, show your baby blues
But baby I've got news for you.

I won't be home tonight.
I'll get along just fine without you
Don't bother callin' me tonight
Oh baby take it somewhere else

Somewhere else
Baby take it somewhere else
Take it somewhere else

I won't be home tonight.
I'll get along just fine without you
Don't bother callin' me tonight
Oh baby take it somewhere else
I won't be home tonight.
I'll get along just fine without you
Don't bother callin' me tonight
Oh baby take it somewhere else
