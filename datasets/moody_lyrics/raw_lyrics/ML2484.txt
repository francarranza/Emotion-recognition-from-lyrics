Sally used to carry my books to school
Sally was a good ole girl
Helped me with my homework 'cause I was a fool
'Cause Sally was a good ole girl.

If you wanted just a kiss or a little bitty squeeze
She was always willing to do her best to please
Yeah, girls were made to love and not made to tease
Sally was a good ole girl.

Yeah, Sally was a good ole girl
Sally was a good ole girl
No matter what the request
She gave it her best
Sally was a good ole girl.

Oh well, Sally's folks were poor
But she helped all she could
Sally was a good ole girl
Hardest working girl in the neighborhood
Sally was a good ole girl.

Well, she walked up and down the street all day
Selling neck ties to the one's who'd pay
If they couldn't afford it then she'd give them away
'Cause Sally was a good ole girl.

Yeah, Sally was a good ole girl
Sally was a good ole girl
No matter what the request
She gave it her best
Sally was a good ole girl.

Well, Sally was a good ole girl
Sally was a good ole girl
No matter what the request
She gave it her best
Sally was a good ole girl.

Well, Sally was a favorite with all of the men
'Cause Sally was a good ole girl
All of the ladies despised her then
'Cause Sally was a good ole girl.

Well, the women talked about her but Sally didn't care
She kept on a workin' and a doin' her share
She wound up and married to a millionare
Sally was a good ole girl.

Yeah, Sally was a good ole girl
Sally was a good ole girl
No matter what the request
She gave it her best
Sally was a good ole girl.

Well, Sally was a good ole girl
Sally was a good ole girl
No matter what the request
She gave it her best
Sally was a good ole girl...
