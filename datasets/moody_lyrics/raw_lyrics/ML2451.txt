Reproduction is not a right it is a privilege
And I'm sick of dealing with your mistakes
The abused and unloved children continue this dysfunctional practice
Parents play an important role in a child's development
And abusive upbringings breed the same
When will this fucking cycle end?
Reproduction is not a right it is a privilege
And I'm sick of dealing with your mistakes
