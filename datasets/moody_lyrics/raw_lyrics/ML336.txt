She calls out to the man on the street
"Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep.
Is there somewhere you can tell me?"

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you, you and me in paradise
Think about it

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk, but she's trying

Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
It's just another day for you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it

Oh, Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh, Lord, there must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cause she didn't fit in there

Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
It's just another day for you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it, mmm hmm
Think about it

It's just another day for you and me in paradise
It's just another day for you and me in paradise
Paradise
Just think about it
Paradise
Just think about
Paradise
Paradise
Paradise
