The day turns into night
The dog will always bite
The serpent's underground
He lies without a sound
So let the serpent sleep
Oh let the serpent sleep
We're frozen underneath
So let the serpent sleep

The worm will eat the peach
There's pebbles on the beach
The swine is in the mud
The eagle flies above
So let the serpent sleep
Oh let the serpent sleep
We're frozen underneath
So let the serpent sleep

The ocean lives and breathes
And man creates machines
Children run away
And night turns into day
So let the serpent sleep
Let the serpent sleep
We're frozen underneath
So let the serpent sleep

Let the serpent sleep
Let the serpent sleep
We're frozen underneath
So let the serpent sleep
