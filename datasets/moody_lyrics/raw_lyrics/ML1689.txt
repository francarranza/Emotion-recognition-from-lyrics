Kill all!
Fight death!
Lesions fighting love.

Fight them all in a living hell.
Slowly rot and you die.
You fight death as you slowly realize.
Kill them all.
Fight death and slowly read in the love.
Fight them all, join me, slowly we rot.
Slowly we rot!

Dead to all.
Fighting as you slowly read in your love.
Fighting the sword.
The sword is your plow.
Dead to all.
Fighting as you're slowly rotting in hell.
Fight them all, join me, slowly we dwell.
Slowly we dwell!

Decharge!
