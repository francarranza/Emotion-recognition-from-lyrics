I've been a lot of places
My feet have kissed this land
I try real hard to remember all the faces
None seem to have what yours demands

I took a train to Chicago
Thought I could clear my mind
I took a plane out to find some truth
But all I found I can't seem to leave behind

I dream of Chicago
I dream of you
I dream I could go and say all the things
That I never said to you

I'm sure I used to love you
I'm sure you made me such a fool
But you were silent with your heart and affections
Tell me, girl, what's a boy supposed to do?

I dream of Chicago
I dream of you
I dream I could go and say all the things
That I never said to you
