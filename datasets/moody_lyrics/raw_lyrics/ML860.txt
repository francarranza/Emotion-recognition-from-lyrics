Hey, we all know how we're gonna die, baby
We're gonna crash and burn, burn, burn, burn, burn...

Mechanized head and a god named Zed
I keep telling you it's all right
A parallax view that you can't unscrew
When it all just gets so tight

Rock, motherfucker
Rock the motherfucker
Rock, motherfucker, yeah
Rock, motherfucker
Rock the motherfucker
Rock, motherfucker, yeah

Chew it up - spit it out
Sick bubblegum
Blow it up - stick it out
Sick bubblegum
Tear it up - push it down
Sick bubblegum
Shove it in - rip it out
Sick bubblegum

A fireproof stick and I ain't so quick
I just make you think I am
Black numb days and a model hather
Brand new illusion scare

Rock, motherfucker
Rock the motherfucker
Rock, motherfucker, yeah

Chew it up - spit it out
Sick bubblegum
Blow it up - stick it out
Sick bubblegum
Tear it up - push it down
Sick bubblegum
Shove it in - rip it out
Sick bubblegum

Remember the coop when you hit the loop
A new god in Hollywood
Diamond daze and your locust plays
You wouldn't make it if you could

Rock, motherfucker
Rock the motherfucker
Rock, motherfucker, yeah

Chew it up - spit it out
Sick bubblegum
Blow it up - stick it out
Sick bubblegum
Tear it up - push it down
Sick bubblegum
Shove it in - rip it out
Sick bubblegum
