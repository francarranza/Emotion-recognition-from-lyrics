I wanna dedicate this song to all the lovers tonight
And I expect that might be the whole world
Because everybody needs something or someone to love

When it's cold outside who are you holding?
You know, if y'all don't mind I'd like to talk about this woman of mine
She's always complainin' 'bout me never bein' at home
But when I'm down broke

She's tellin' me about the things that her girlfriend's got
What she ain't got and she wants me to go out and get 'em for her
But girl, I can't be in two places at one time

If you think you're lonely now, huh
Wait until tonight, girl
(If you think you're lonely now)
I'll be long gone
(Wait until tonight, girl)
And you'll find another man that'll treat you right

(If you think you're lonely now)
When I ain't there to rub your back
(Wait until tonight, girl)
Just remember I made it a long fact

And it's gotta just come out of the closet
And chase you all around your room
And the memories sail 'round like a ghost
And that's a matter of fact, no joke, ah

If you think you're lonely now
(If you think you're lonely now)
Oh, wait until tonight
(Wait until tonight, girl)

I'll be long gone
(If you think you're lonely now)
And you'll never find another man that'll treat you right
(You just wait until tonight, girl)

(If you think you're lonely now)
You think you're lonely now
(Wait until tonight, girl)
Wait, wait, wait until tonight, girl

Oh, ain't it funny how the tables turn
When things aren't goin' your way?
But when love runs out and the pain walks in
And settles for a stay, ooh

(If you think you're lonely now)
Lord, help me, I feel like I wanna testify
(Wait until tonight, girl)
(If you think you're lonely now)
Girl, wait until tonight
(Wait until tonight, girl)
If you think you're lonely, lonely now

(If you think you're lonely now)
(Wait until tonight, girl)
Oh, you just wait until tonight, girl
(If you think you're lonely now)
(Wait until tonight, girl)

You see tonight's the night when the needs come out
When your needs come out to breathe
And you toast the stars and there ain't now way you can sleep, ooh

(If you think you're lonely now)
If you think you're lonely now
(Wait until tonight, girl)
I feel like I wanna testify this evenin'

(If you think you're lonely now)
I'm lonely, 'cause I know I gotta leave you, oh, girl
(Wait until tonight, girl)
I just can't take no more

(If you think you're lonely now)
Ooh, hoo, hoo
(You just wait until tonight, girl)
Ah, girl, you just wait

(If you think you're lonely now)
If you think you got problems now, baby, you just wait
(Wait until tonight, girl)
Wait

(If you think you're lonely now)
Too far gone
(Wait until tonight, girl)
Like you're runnin' out

(If you think you're lonely now)
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, babe
(Wait until tonight, girl)
You say you're a little lonely

(If you think you're lonely now)
But everybody needs somebody to love
(Wait until tonight, girl)
(If you think you're lonely now)
It's good that you know that you got somebody that'll stand by your side
That'll build you up when you're fallin' down
(Wait until tonight, girl)
And you had that someone, baby

(If you think you're lonely now)
'Cause I've done my time
(Wait until tonight, girl)
And it's your turn now

(If you think you're lonely now)
If you think you're lonely now
(Wait until tonight, girl)
Wait, wait until tonight

(If you think you're lonely now)
I'm tired, tired of this same old stuck in the hour
(Wait until tonight, girl)
It's been too long

(If you think you're lonely now)
You think, you could start all over again, it's been too long
(Wait until tonight, girl)
You think you could start it just one more time
(If you think you're lonely now)
