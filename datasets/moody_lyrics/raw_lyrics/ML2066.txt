Two kinds of people in this world
Winners, losers
I lost my power in this world
'Cause I did not use it

So I go insane
Like I always do
And I call your name
She's a lot like you

Two kinds of trouble in this world
Living, dying
I lost my power in this world
And the rumors are flying

So I go insane
Like I always do
And I call your name
She's a lot like you
