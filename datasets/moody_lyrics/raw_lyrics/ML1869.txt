I am not in love 
But I'm open to persuasion 
East or West 
Where's the best 
For romancing

With a friend 
I can smile 
But with a lover 
I could hold my head back 
I could really laugh 
Really laugh

Thank you 
You took me dancing 
'Cross the floor 
Cheek to cheek 
But with a lover 
I could really move 
Really move 
I could really dance 
Really dance 
Really dance 
Really dance 
I could really move 
Really move 
Really move 
Really move

Now if I can feel the sun 
In my eyes 
And the rain on my face 
Why can't I 
Feel love

I can really love 
Really love 
Really love 
Really love 
Really love 
Love love love love 
Love love love love

Now I got all 
The friends that I want 
I may need more 
But I shall just stick to those 
That I have got 
With friends I still feel 
So insecure

Little darling I believe you could 
Help me a lot 
Just take my hand 
And lead me where you will 
No conversation 
No wave goodnight 
Just make love 
With affection

Sing me another love song 
But this time 
With a little dedication 
Sing it, sing it 
You know that's what I like 
Once more with feeling 
Give me love 
Give me love 
Give me love 
Love...
