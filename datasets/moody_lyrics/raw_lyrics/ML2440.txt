Man's fall a cause for my hatred
It turns to rage and is repressed inside
To hide inside
To strike me blind with my anger stricken with rage
But in me a passion dwells to give all that I have
I can no longer hide this hate for the world
I can no longer hide this hate for what you have done
You take your broken path but never expect me to follow
I'll take your tired lies and shove them all back down your throat
