When we go for a little walk out on the land
When we're just walkin' and holdin' hands

You can take it as a sign of love when the winds of fate
Keep blowin' and we both understand

Sign of love, it's a sign of love
Sign of love, sign of love

When we both have silver hair and a little less time
But there still are roses on the vine

You can take it as a sign of love when I look at you
When I'm lookin' at you for a long, long time

It's a sign of love, a sign of love
Sign of love, sign of love
Sign of love

When I first saw you, you were just a girl and I was a man
While the music played I watched you dance

Sign of love, it was a sign of love
Sign of love, sign of love
Sign of love
