Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie

The full moon is rising over dark waters
And the fools below are picking up sticks
And the man in the gallows lies permanently waiting
For the doctors to come back at 10 AM

The flat earth society is meeting here today
Singing happy little lies
And the bright ship Humana is sailing far away
With grave determination and no destination

Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie

Yeah, nothing feels better than a spray of clean water
And the whistling wind on a calm summer night
But you'd better believe that down in their quarters
The men are holding in for their dear lives

The flat earth society is somewhere far away
With their candlesticks and compasses
And the bright ship Humana is well on its way
With grave determination and no destination

The flat earth society is meeting here today
Singing happy little lies
And the bright ship Humana is well on its way
With grave determination and no destination

Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie
