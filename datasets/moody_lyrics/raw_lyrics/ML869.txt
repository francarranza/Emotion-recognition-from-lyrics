Isn't it a pity, now isn't it a shame?
How we break each other's hearts
And cause each other pain
How we take each other's love
Without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back
Isn't it a pity?

Some things take so long, but how do I explain
When not too many people
Can see we're all the same?
And because of all their tears
Their eyes can't hope to see
The beauty that surrounds them
Isn't it a pity?

Isn't it a pity, isn't it a shame?
How we break each other's hearts
And cause each other pain
How we take each other's love
Without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back
Isn't it a pity?

Forgetting to give back
Isn't it a pity?

Forgetting to give back
Now, isn't it a pity?
