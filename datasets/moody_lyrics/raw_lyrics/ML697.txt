I should be saying goodnight
I really shouldn't stay anymore
It's been so long since I held you
Forgotten what love is for

I should run on the double
(I think I'm in) I think I'm in trouble
(I think I'm in) Trouble
(I think I'm in) (Yes) I think I'm in trouble

Come to me darling and hold me
Let your honey keep you warm
Been so long since I held you
Forgotten what love is for

I should run on the double
(I think I'm in) I think I'm in trouble
(I think I'm in) Trouble
(I think I'm in) (Yes) I think I'm in trouble
(I think I'm in) I think I'm in trouble

I should run on the double
(I think I'm in) I think I'm in trouble
(I think I'm in) Trouble
(I think I'm in) I think I'm in trouble
(I think I'm in) I think I'm in trouble
