You see things
And have epiphanies
I run away
Scared of what you'll say

The smoke billowing

You say things
And have epiphanies
I lie awake
Scared of what I'll say

The smoke billowing

From my eyes to yours
From my mind to yours

Everything you said to me
Is swishing in my head
Like a bullet in my head
