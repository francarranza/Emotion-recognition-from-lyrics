If I thought I knew the reason
Why I've gone and fallen in love with you?
You're the one thing I believe in
And I know quite well what I've got to do
First you say it's OK then you say there's no way
Then I'm making love to you
You're the one thing I believe in
And know it's time 'cause I've got to tell you

My love is like a flower, daisies are always free pulling out the petals
I wonder if you love me, love me, love, love me, love me

If I thought I knew the reason
Why I've gone and fallen in love with you?
You're the one thing I believe in
And I know it's time because I've got to tell you
First you say it's OK then you say there's no way
Then I'm making love to you
You're the one thing I believe in
And I'll get my way or I'm going to kill you
