We call them cool
Those hearts who have no scars to show
The ones that never do let go
And risk the tables being turned

We call them fools
Who have to dance within the flames
Who chance the sorrow and the shame
That always comes with getting burned

But you got to be tough when consumed by desire
'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire

We call them strong
Those who can face this world alone
Who seem to get by on their own
Those who will never take the fall

We call them weak
Who are unable to resist
The slightest chance love might exsist
And for that forsake it all

They're so hell-bent on giving
Walking a wire
Convinced it's not living
If you stand outside the fire

Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

There's this love that is burning
Deep in my soul constantly yearning to get out of control
Wanting to glide higher and higher
I can't abide standing outside the fire

Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire
