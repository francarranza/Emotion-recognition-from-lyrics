Baby don't turn out the light
I wanna see you look at me
Whisper only truth tonight
Not just promises and empty fantasies

I don't need a bed of roses
'Cause roses wither away
All I really need is honesty
From someone with a strong heart (strong heart), a gentle hand
Who'll take me as I am

Baby I need for you to know
Just exactly how I feel
Firey passions come and go
I'd trade a million pretty words for one touch that is real

I don't need a bed of roses
'Cause roses wither away
All I really need is honesty
From someone with a strong heart (strong heart), a gentle hand
Who'll take me as I am

I don't need a bed of roses
'Cause roses wither away
All I really need is honesty
From someone with a strong heart (strong heart), a gentle hand
Who'll take me as I am
I don't need a bed of roses
'Cause roses wither away
All I really need is honesty
From someone with a strong heart (strong heart), a gentle hand
Who'll take me as I am

I don't need a bed of roses
'Cause roses wither away
All I really need is honesty
From someone with a strong heart (strong heart), a gentle hand
Who'll take me as I am
From someone with a strrong heart (strong heart), a gentle hand
Who'll take me as I am
