Wire fences still coiled with flowers of the night
Songs of the birds like hands call the earth to witness
Sever from fear before taking flight

Fences that fail and fall to the ground
Bearing the fruit from Jara's Hands

Me siento solo y perdido
Una vela alumbra mi camino
Cruzando tierras que nunca he visto
Cruzando el río de mi destino
Solo soy un chico mas
Que sueña en alto y mirando al mar

Fences that fail and fall to the ground
Bearing the fruit from Jara's Hands
Fences that fail and fall to the ground
Bearing the fruit from Jara's Hands
