I'm scared to try 'cause I'm scared to fail
I'm scared to die 'cause I'm scared of hell
I'm scared to kiss scared to hug
I'm scared of sex 'cause I'm scared to touch

I'm scared to look 'cause I'm scared to see
I'm scared of you 'cause I'm scared of me
I'm scared to fly 'cause I'm scared to crash
I'm scared to move on so I live in the past

I'm scared to fight 'cause I'm scared to bleed
I'm scared of love 'cause I'm scared he'll live
I'm scared of drugs I'm scared to drink
I'm scared to swim 'cause I'm scared to sink

I'm scared to learn 'cause I'm scared of truth
Don't wanna gain weight 'cause I'm scared of food
I'm scared to think that the label dropped me
I'm scared to think of my album floppin'

This may sound silly but it's true
So don't pretend it ain't you too
We all afraid of something here
'Cause you ain't human without fear

I'm scared to start 'cause I'm scared I'll quit
I'm scared that people wont like my shit
I'm scared of fame and paparazzi
Rumors startin' and people watching

Scared to grow up 'cause I'm scared to grow old
Scared of the dark and begin alone
I'm scared of war I'm scared of jail
Scared to share a secret 'cause I'm scared you'll tell

This may sound silly but it's true
So don't pretend it ain't you too
We all afraid of something here
'Cause you ain't human without fear
