My love, my love is a mountainside
So firm, So firm it can calm the tide
My love for you is a mountainside
It stands so firm it can calm the tide
That's why my love,
My love is a mountainside

My love, my love is an ocean's roar
So strong, so strong that I can't let you go
My love for you is an ocean's roar
It's grown so strong that I can't let you go
That's why my love, my love is
An ocean's roar

My love is longer than forever
And endless as the march of time
Till ninety-nine years after never
In my heart you'll still be mine
Because my love

My love is a deep blue sea
So deep, so deep that I'll never be free
My love for you is a deep blue sea
It's grown so strong that I'll never be free
That's why my love
My love is a deep blue sea
