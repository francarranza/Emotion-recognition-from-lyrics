Sho' look good but you don't mean a thing to me
Sho' look good but you don't mean a thing to me
I got a hip shakin' beauty, shake like a willow tree

You went away baby, you got back a little too late
You went away baby, you got back a little too late
I got a cool shakin' baby, shake like jello on a plate

What my baby want, you know she found in my arm
What my baby want, you know she found in my arm
Every time she stop, her flush hips shake like jello

Oh shake it baby
Shake it for me
Oh shake little baby
Shake it for me
Oh shake little baby, do that
Shake like a willow tree
