Habit alone, when separate I moan.
Feeding on bones or anything grown.
I command post and nobody shows
In mornings I rest here,
In evenings I work here,
My debt isn't spent till the rest of me's left.
All I adore...

You must be the call
The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights.
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.

I work alone saving my soul
If yesterday hurts, tomorrow is worse.
Send me a sign, for my body's aligned.
I'm ready to waste all my limbs and my face
My pores are wide open
And bleed for your potion,
Spellwork and lies!

You must be the call
The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights.
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.

You must be the call
The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights.
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire.
