Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying, 
But you've got the love I need To see me through

Sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
Now and then it seems that life is just too much
But you've got the love I need to see me through

When food is gone you are my daily meal, oh
When friends are gone I know my savior's love is real
You know it's is real

You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

Time after time I think, 
Time after time I think it's just no good
Sooner or later in life, the things you love you lose
But you got the love I need to see me through

You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
'Cause I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying, 
But you've got the love I need to see me through
