Some modest dreams, they just don't pay out
Some modest means don't leave much way out
In every cradle there's a grave now
In every owner there's a slave now

Heard somewhere that there is a place now
Someone who'll catch you on your way down
But in every captain there's a kid now
In every chaplain there's an id now

So make sure you keep your bunk beds made
One day you'll see your bunker walls degrade
And in every garden there's a snake now
In every pardon there's mistake now

When you fall on the ground
Not a sound, army bound
When you're all no account
No amount, army bound

When your vests or your gowns
Hand-me-downs, army bound
When what's next looks unsound
Shaky ground, army bound

Working hard for a round
To the crown, army bound
While you march from your town
To renown, army bound
