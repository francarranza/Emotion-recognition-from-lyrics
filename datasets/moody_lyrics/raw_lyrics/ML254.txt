This is how we know
 This is how we know what love is
 Just one look at Your cross
 And this is where we see
 This is where we see how love works
 For You surrendered Your all
 
And this is how we know
 That You have loved us first
 This is where we chose
 To love You in return
 
For You so loved the world
 That You gave Your only Son
 Love amazing, so divine
 We will love You in return
 For this life that You give
 For this death that You have died
 Love amazing, so divine
 We will love You in reply, Lord
