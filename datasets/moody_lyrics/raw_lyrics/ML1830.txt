A dead issue
Don't wrestle with it
Deaf ears are sleeping
A guilty bliss
So inviting 
(Let me in)
Nailed to the cross

I feel you
Relate to you
Accuse you
Wash away us all
Take us with the floods

Then throughout the night
They were raped and executed
(Then throughout the night
They were raped and executed)
Cold hearted world

Your language unheard of
The vast sound of tuning out
The rash of negativity 
(The rash of negativity)
Is seen one sidedly
(One sidedly)
Burn away the day

The nervous
The drifting
The heaving
Wash away us all
Take us with the floods

Then throughout the day 
Mankind played with grenades
(Then throughout the day 
Mankind played with grenades)
Cold hearted world

And at night 
They might bait the pentagram
(And at night 
They might bait the pentagram)
Extinguishing the sun
Wash away man
Take him with the floods

Flood, flood, flood
Flood, flood, flood

Flood, flood, flood
Flood, flood, flood

Flood, flood, flood
Flood, flood, flood

Flood, flood, flood
Flood, flood, flood
