Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And I am livin' for you alone
Did I remember to say
I'm lost without you
And just how mad about you I've grown
You were in my arms
And that was all I knew
We were alone, we two
What did I say to you
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And pray forevermore you'll be mine
