They say that it's a matter of trusting 
Before love has a chance to begin 
And it's never simple 
Faithless hearts can cripple 
And only a strong love survives 
I know they say that it's a fine line 
Between giving up and giving in 
But once your heart's been in it 
You just can't forget it 
It's like nothing that you've felt in your life 

We got real love 
Not infatuation 
Real love 
Our hearts' celebration 
I love you 
Real love 
Not an imitation 
Real love 
You're my destination 
Baby, you and me 
We got everything we need 

You are such a part of my life 
That I can't remember me without you 
And we've had our nights 
We've had our share of fights 
But we've never thought of giving it up 

Oh, you and I we must be dreamers 
'Cause we're making our dreams come true 
I could spend my life 
Just holding you so tight 
And never, ever get enough 

We got real love 
Not infatuation 
Real love 
Our hearts' celebration 
I love you 
Real love 
Not an imitation 
Real love 
You're my destination 
Baby, you and me 
We got everything we need 

We got real love 

We got real love 
Not infatuation 
Real love 
Our hearts' celebration 
I love you 
Real love 
Not an imitation 
Real love 
You're my destination 
Baby, you and me 
We got everything we need 

We got real love 
Not infatuation 
Real love 
Our hearts' celebration 
I love you 
Real love 
Not an imitation 
Real love 
You're my destination 
Baby, you and me 
We got everything we need
