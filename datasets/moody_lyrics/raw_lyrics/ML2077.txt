Gimme danger, little stranger
And I feel with you at ease
Gimme danger, little stranger
And I'll heal your disease
There's nothing in my dreams just some ugly memories
Kiss me like the ocean breeze

Hey

Now if you will be my lover
I will shiver and sing
But if you can be my master
I will do anything
There's nothing left alive but a pair of glassy eyes
Raise my feelings one more time

Yeah

Come on little danger, die a little stranger
Swear you're gonna feel my hand
Come on little stranger, die a little later
Swear you're gonna feel my hand
Swear you're gonna feel my hand

Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Gimme danger
Can you feel it?
You gotta feel it, I gotta feel it
Gimme danger
