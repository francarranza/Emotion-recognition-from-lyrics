I used to stay out late, I had a party disease
I could've wrecked my car, I couldn't find the keys
I heard the voice of God tell me to leave it alone
"You got a train to catch out of the danger zone"

I used to shake my fist, I was an angry boy
Wanting to fight the world, I didn't know what for
I heard the voice of God tell me to leave it alone
"You got a bus to catch out of the danger zone"

Heard Him say, hey, hey, hey, you can go
Heard Him say, hey, hey, hey
Headed for another world, out of the danger zone

Though I was good and safe, acted like a natural fool
I thought that life was a game, I didn't know the rules
I heard the voice of God tell me to leave it alone
"You got a train to catch out of the danger zone"

Heard Him say, hey, hey, hey, you can go
I heard Him say, hey, hey, hey
Headed for another world, out of the danger zone

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Out of the danger zone

I used to stay out late, I had a party disease
I would've wrecked my car, I couldn't find the keys
I heard the voice of God tell me to leave it alone
"You got a train to catch out of the danger zone"

Heard Him say, hey, hey, hey, you can go
I heard Him say, hey, hey, hey
Headed for another world, out of the danger zone

Yeah, out of the danger zone
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Out of the danger zone
Out of the danger zone
Yeah, out of the danger zone, whoo!
