No pictures
No flowers
Crumbling towers
Glamorize the fallen rubble
Stirring up all this trouble
Spreading the fear in the poison city
Toilets clogged with Blackwater
Are we not being terrorized?
Two faced conceit
Anesthetized
Buttoned down dollar signs
Their collective bully mind
Spreading the fear in the poison city
Toilets clogged with Blackwater
No pictures
No flowers
Crumbling towers
Glamorize the fallen rubble
Stirring up all this trouble
