I can't help myself
I'm addicted to a life of material
It's some kind of joke
I'm obsessively opposed to the typical

All we care about is
Runway models, Cadillacs and liquor bottles
Give me something, I wanna be
Retro glamour, Hollywood, yes, we live for the

Fame 
Doin' it for the Fame 
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame 
Doin' it for the fame 
'Cause we gotta taste for champagne and endless fortune

Fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
We live for the fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
Isn't it a shame, shame, baby, a shame, shame?
In it for the fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame

I can see myself in the movies
With my picture in the city lights
Photograph my mind
And whatever else you'd like to shoot, you decide

All we care about is
Pornographic girls on film and body plastic
Give me something, I wanna see
Television and hot blondes in odd positions

Fame 
Doin' it for the Fame 
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame 
Doin' it for the fame 
'Cause we gotta taste for champagne and endless fortune

Fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
We live for the fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
Isn't it a shame, shame, baby, a shame, shame?
In it for the fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame

Don't ask me how or why
But I'm gonna make it happen this time 
My teenage dream tonight 
Yeah, I'm gonna make it happen this time 

Fame 
Doin' it for the Fame 
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame 
Doin' it for the fame 
'Cause we gotta taste for champagne and endless fortune

Fame 
Doin' it for the Fame 
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame 
Doin' it for the fame 
'Cause we gotta taste for champagne and endless fortune
