Darkness at the bottom
Of a hole I didn't dig
Darkness at the bottom
Of a hole I didn't dig
Yeah, I'm down here on my knees
Beggin' you please Lord
Save me before I'm losin' it

It leaves me wondering
Is this how it's gonna be
It leaves me wondering
Is this how it's gonna be
Everbody's talking
Nobody's listening

Darkness at the bottom
Of a hole I didn't dig
Darkness at the bottom
Of a hole I didn't dig
Yeah, I'm down here on my knees
Crawlin' in the mud

Just like a pig

Hearing is believing
Tell me what you need to know
Hearing is believing
Tell me what you need to know
Yeah, everybody's pushing
But we ain't got nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

Darkness at the bottom
Of a whole lot of misery
Darkness down here at the bottom
Of a whole lot of misery
Yeah, I've seen blood turn into water
And a whole lotta low down greed
Whole lotta low down greed
