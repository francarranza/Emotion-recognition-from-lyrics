Clouds part
Just to give us a little sun

There's a limit to your love
Like a waterfall in slow motion
Like a map with no ocean
There's a limit to your love
Your love, your love, your love

There's a limit to your care
So carelessly there
Is it truth or dare?
There's a limit to your care

I love, I love, I love
This dream of going upstream
I love, I love, I love
The trouble that you give me
I know, I know, I know
That only I can save me
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go
Right down the road

There's a limit to your love
Like a waterfall in slow motion
Like a map with no ocean
There's a limit to your love
Your love, your love, your love

I can't read your smile
It should be written on your face
I'm piecing it together
There's something out of place

I love, I love, I love
This dream of going upstream
I love, I love, I love
All the trouble that you give me
I know, I know, I know
That only I can save me
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go
Out on the road

Because there is no limit
There's no limit
No limit, no limit, no limit
To my love
