Ooh, a storm is threatnin'
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away

War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away ()

Ooh, see the fire is sweepin'
Our very streets today
Burns like a red coal carpet
Mad bull, lost its way

War, children, yes
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away ()

Mmm, the floods is threatnin'
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm gonna fade away

War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

I tell you love, sister
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, kiss away, kiss away, yeah
