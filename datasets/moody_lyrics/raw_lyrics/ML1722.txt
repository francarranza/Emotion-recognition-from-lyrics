Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better
This Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together
This Christmas

The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah

Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you
This Christmas
Lights twinkle all around
But your eyes outshine the town
They do, this Christmas

The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah
This Christmas will be 
A very special Christmas for me, yeah

The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
Yeah, this Christmas

Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better
This Christmas
This Christmas
Yeah, this Christmas will be a very special Christmas for me
This Christmas
Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better
This Christmas
This Christmas
Yeah this Christmas
Yeah, we're gonna be together
