Stretch the bones over my skin
Stretch the skin over my hand
I'm going to the holy land
Stretch the marks over my eyes
Burn the candles deep inside
Yeah, you know where I'm coming from

So give up the greed, you don't have to feed me, yeah
Give up to fate, you don't have to need me
So let it go, to let it go, to let it go, to let it
Drown me in you

So slip down the darkness to the mouth
Damn the water, burn the wine
I'm going home for the very last time

So throw it away, you don't have to take me, yeah
Make no mistakes, I am what you make me
So let it go, to let it go, to let it go, to let it
Drown me in you, drown me in you, drown me in you, drown me in you
Drown me in, drown me in, oh, drown me in, yeah, drown me in, yeah

Ooh

I see you turn around
And burning down, the feeling starts to sink
I feel the hurt surround me
Please dissolve me
She's resolved to

So heal my wounds without a trace
And seal my tomb without my face
I'm going to the lonely place

Give up to greed, you don't have to feed me
Give up to fate, you don't have to need me
So let it go, to let it go, to let it go, to let it
Drown me in you, drown me in you, drown me in you, drown me in you
Drown me in you, yeah, drown me in you, yeah, drown me in you, yeah, drown me in you
Drown me in
