I got a kindhearted woman
Do anything in this world for me
I got a kindhearted woman
Do anything in this world for me
And these evil-hearted women
Man, they will not let me be

Oh, I love my baby
But my baby don't love me
I said I love my baby
Ooh, my baby don't love me
You know I love that man
Can't stand to leave him be

Ain't but the one thing
That makes Mister Johnson drink
I'm worried about how you treat me, baby
I begin to think

Oh, babe
My life don't feel the same
You know you break my heart
When you call Miss So-and-So's name

She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
You will to kill me
As you have it on your mind

No, no, I love my baby
My baby don't love me, no
You know I love my baby
Ooh, but my baby don't love me
I really love that man
Can't stand to leave him be
