Lately I'm learnin'
That so many yearnings are never to be
The childhood illusions
Are merely delusions of a girl that I see

In my mind's eye
I see clearly a vision of how it could be

Me and my fantasy girl
Hold on to me
Be my fantasy girl
Don't set me free

Now I've had my share
But sometimes I swear that I've had me enough
You end up in sorrow
Broken tomorrows, love can be tough

But my mind's eye
Sees a vision of true love and how it should be

Me and my fantasy girl
Hold on to me
Be my fantasy girl
Don't set me free
Be my fantasy

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I see clearly a vision of how it could be, yeah
Be my fantasy 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Be my fantasy girl
Hold on to me
You're my fantasy girl
Don't set me free

Be my fantasy girl 
Hold on to me
You're my fantasy girl
Don't set me free, yeah
From this fantasy
