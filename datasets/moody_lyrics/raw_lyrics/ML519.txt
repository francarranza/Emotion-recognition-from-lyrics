Don't wanna take it slow
I wanna take you home
And watch the world explode
From underneath your glow

I wanna watch the way
You creep across my skull

You slowly enter
'Cause you know my room
And then you crawl your knees off
Before you shake my tomb

I wanna watch you close
I need to see for sure
After the tape is through
Who do you think we can show?

I wanna watch the way
You creep across my skull

You slowly enter
'Cause you know my room
And then you crawl your knees off
And then you shake my tomb

I wanna watch the way
You creep across my skull

You slowly enter
'Cause you know my room
And then you crawl your knees off
Before you shake my tomb

You enter slowly
You know my room
You crawl your knees off
And then you shake my tomb
