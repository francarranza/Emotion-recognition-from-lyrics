Yeah I'm out there braving it all
Yeah I'm out there
Caught out there
In the wind I hear

You better wise up

So, I'm out there cutting it up
All the while just getting beat up
Yeah I'm out there
Caught out there
In the wind I hear

You better wise up
You better wise up
Wise up

You better wise up
You better wise up
Wise up

Change change change your fate
Change change your fate or make your bed and live in it

You better wise up
You better wise up
You better wise up
You better wise up
