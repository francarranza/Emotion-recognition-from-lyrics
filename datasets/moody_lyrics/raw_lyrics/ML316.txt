Sweetheart, I can't stop thinking about you
You'll always be in my dreams
You'll always be in my dreams
You'll always be in my dreams

Never in my dreams I thought I'd be with you
You're often on my mind
I'll always love you

When I close my eyes just to see your face
I wish this were real
But I'm just dreaming

I can't believe that this is all in a dream
I'm gonna wait to be with you, my love
I'll always love you and want you more
I can't go on without your love

In a dream, my love
You will find my heart
In a dream, my love
You will find my heart

In a dream, my love
You will find my heart
In a dream, my love
You will find my heart

You are an angel
You have to be
You'd take me to heaven

Never leave, never go away
Please, stay with me tonight
I need you with me

Can't believe that this is all in a dream
I'm gonna wait to be with you my love
I'll always love you and want you more
I can't go on without your love

In a dream, my love
You will find my heart
In a dream, my love
You will find my heart

In a dream, my love
You will find my heart
In a dream, my love
You will find my heart
