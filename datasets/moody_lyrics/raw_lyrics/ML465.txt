My father he done told me
To never ever hurt no one
But now I'm sick an' mad and I been caught red handed
And I'm still father's son

I lay awake till daylight
A pillow and a gun
And if my secret dreams could be seen on screen
Then they'll be coming for this one

So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord

Please lord now forgive me
Even though I don't deserve
I never was too good in life
The devil's all I serve
My woman she done left me
I told twice to go
The first time she ignored me
But then I threw her on the floor

So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord

Well I sleep with one eye open
I weep with both eyes closed
Darkness coming down on me and
Tomorrow never knows

Ever I suffer
Ever suffer my fill
And if you don't pray for me now
Nobody ever will

So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord

Now I'm in the graveyard
It's darkness all around
Voices floating through the air speaking with no sound
You were your father's son
But you left him far beyond
Beyond the reach of mercy
In the darkness of the sun

So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord

So down low better slow down lord
I'm so down low better slow down lord
I'm so down low better slow down lord
I'm so down low better slow down lord
