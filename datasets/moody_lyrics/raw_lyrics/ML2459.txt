Do not be afraid little lamb
Trust Him while you are sleeping
Angels over your cradle will stand
Silent watch they are keeping

Think about these things
And love will guide your dreams
And He will keep you in perfect peace
Perfect peace, perfect peace
He will keep you in perfect peace
If you keep your mind on Him

You are never along little lamb
For the Father is near you
You are tenderly held in his hands
Whisper and he will hear you

Think about these things
And love will guide your dreams
And He will keep you in perfect peace
Perfect peace, perfect peace
He will keep you in perfect peace
If you keep your mind on Him
