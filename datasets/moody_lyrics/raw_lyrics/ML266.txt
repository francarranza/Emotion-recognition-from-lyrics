There was a light, but I don't care
We both know that it's foolish

And what's become of it is in my heart
Oh, but it's a big part

Oh and I won't waste any more of your time
Oh and I won't waste any more time

I don't know myself
Oh, but I know you
How can you be so callous?

Oh, don't ever say that we stopped being fair
Or that you don't rely on me when no one else is there... any more

Oh, why can't we both talk?
I must have taught myself
That it's a lie on both sides of you

Oh and I won't waste any more of your time
Oh and I won't waste any more time
Oh and I won't waste any more of your time
And no I won't waste any more time

Give me pain and pain's outlet, too

When you're miserable
Living eyes
Can't ???
To the bottom of the dark
When you're miserable

Oh and I won't waste any more of your time
And no I won't waste any more time
I won't waste anymore of your time
And no I won't waste any more time

There was a light, but I don't care
We both know that it's foolish
We both know that it's foolish
Oh, don't rely on me
Oh, don't
Don't rely on me

I don't know myself
Oh but I know you
How can you be so callous?
How can you be so callous?
