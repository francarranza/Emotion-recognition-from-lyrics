Fire cracker!
You waved in the night
And something that I saw was flaming
Your body, it was real in the light
On the Fourth of July we were screaming

Well, I saw the lonely road
You left and said to me don't follow
'Cause I'll only bring you sorrow
And on down my lonely road
You left and I just said,
"Oh no, no, no, no, no."
All I said,
"No, no, no, no, no."

Well I'm back in my old town again
Is there something still alive that I left Here?
You still like the boys on the street
I will take you uptown just to see you Meet them

And I saw the lonely road
You left and said to me don't follow
'Cause I'll only bring you sorrow
And on down my lonely road
You left and I just said,
"Oh no, no, no, no, no."
All I said,
"No, no, no, no, no."

You know, I've been reading the bible For a change
Maybe there's something I have missed There
I said, I've seen, well, I've seen some Eyes in the rain
And they creep at my mind and I saw You whisper
Well, fire cracker you waved in the night
And something that I saw was flaming
Do you feel like we left something here?
Something worth coming back and Claiming?

Well, I saw the lonely road
You left and said to me don't follow
'Cause I'll only bring you sorrow
And on down my lonely road
You left and said to me don't follow
You sleep and dream for tomorrow

Down in the dead of night
You left and said to me don't follow
'Cause I'll only bring you sorrow
And on down my lonely road
You left and I just said,
"Oh no, no, no, no, no."
Well, I said,
No, no, no, no, no
