Words of love, so soft and tender
Won't win a girl's heart anymore
If you love her then you must send her
Somewhere where she's never been before
Worn out phrases and longin' gazes
Won't get you where you want to go, no
Words of love, soft and tender
Won't win her

You oughta know by now
You oughta know, you oughta know by now

Words of love, soft and tender 
Won't win her anymore

You oughta know by now
You oughta know, you oughta know by now

Words of love, soft and tender
Won't win a girl's heart anymore
If you love her then you must send her
Somewhere where she's never been before
Worn out phrases and longin' gazes
Won't get you where you want to go

Words of love, soft and tender
Won't win her anymore, anymore
