You can see that you're being surrounded from every direction
Love was just something you found to add to your collection
It used to seem we were number one, but now it sounds so far away
I had a dream we were running from some blazing arrows yesterday

You said fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Through desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire

Now the city blocks out the sun that you know is rising
You can show me the work that you've done, your fears have been disguising,
Is it just me or is everyone, hiding out between the lights
Where will we be when we've come undone? Just a simple meeting of the minds

Singing we'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Through desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire
We'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Your desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire

Underneath your stars
There's a million lies burning brightly just like fireflies

It's cold and heaven surround you from every direction
Cause there's someone behind every hand that you've made a connection
And now we're free to be number one, the morning isn't far away
I had a dream we were holding on and tomorrow has become today, become today

And now we're free to be number one, the morning isn't far away
We've got a reason to keep holding on, tomorrow has become today

And we'll fight with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Through desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire
We'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Your desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire
