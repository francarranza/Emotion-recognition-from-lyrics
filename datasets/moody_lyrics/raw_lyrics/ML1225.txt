Hmmmm...

Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with love for me
And I will open up my heart
And let the healer set me free
I'm happy to be in the truth
And I will daily lift my hands
For I will always sing
Of when Your love came down, yeah

I could sing of
I could sing of Your love
Forever

Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with love for me
And I will open up my heart
And let the healer set me free
I'm happy to be in the truth
And I will daily lift my hands
For I will always sing
Of when Your love came down, yeah

But when the world has seen the light
They will dance with joy
Like we're dancing now, yeah

This next song seems to have, um, to be honest, taken us completely by surprise
And it seems to have spread all, all around the world, and uh
Been sung in many different places
We've recorded it in Spanish, believe it or not, and uh...sí
Along with many other Cutting Edge songs.  Ha, ha, ha
