Morning has just begun
And I gaze into the rising sun
Like every day to day you're on my mind
And even though I am far I know where you are

And I know it won't be very long
I'll be on my way, coming home

I smell your perfume on the breeze
As a hint of jasmine's calling me
While the trees are whispering your name
And all the things that they do remind me of you

And I know it won't be very long
I'll be on my way coming home
Going home, sweet home
(Home, home)
Very soon I will be coming home

Home, baby, home
(Home, home)
To my lady home
(Home)

That's where my heart is home
(Home)
I'm coming home, I'm coming, I'm coming
(Home, home)

Home to my babies I'm coming home
(Home)
To my lady, home
(Home)

Home, home, home, home, home

So tonight before you go to sleep
And you pray on high our souls to keep
Then cast your dreams to the stars above
And when you awake, I'll gently touch your face

All your lonely moments will be gone
When I'm all alone, I am home
I'm home, sweet home
(Home, home)
Very soon I will be coming home

I'm coming home, baby
(Home)
Coming home, sweet darling
(Home)

I'm coming home to you, baby
(Home)
Coming home
(Home)

Home, that's where my heart is
(Home)
Home, no, it's never a-parted
(Home)
Soon coming home
(Home, home, home)

Baby, baby, coming home to my lady
(Home, home, home)
Yes, babe, coming home to my baby
(Home, home, home)

Home to my lady
(Home, home)
Soon and very soon
I will be coming home
