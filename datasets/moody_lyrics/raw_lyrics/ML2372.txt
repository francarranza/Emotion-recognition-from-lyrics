Feel alone
All I do is say
I alone can be your kind

This is not the same
I am not the same
I can feel you come in two and three
This is not the same
I am not the same
When I feel awake

Close your eyes
Everything I've seen
I this time can be your mind

This is not the same
I am not the same
I can feel you come in two and three
This is not the same
I am not the same
Then I feel awake

Let God cry
Then I'll wash it away
Let God cry
Then I'll wash it away

Dry your eyes
Everything must change
I this time can be your life

This is not the same
I am not the same
I can feel you come in two and three
This is not the same
I am not the same
Then I feel awake

Let God cry
Then I'll wash it away
Let God cry
Then I'll wash it away


This is not the same
I am not the same
I can feel you come in two and three
This is not the same
I am not the same
I can feel it come back home
So home

Please
Let
My
My son

This is not the same
I am not the same
I can feel you come in two and three
This is not the same
I am not the same
Then I feel awake

This is not the same
I am not the same
I can feel you come in two and three
This is not the same
I am not the same
This is not the same
I am not the same

Let God cry
Then I'll wash it away
Let God cry
Then I'll wash it away

This is not the same
I am not the same
I can feel you come in two and three
This is not the same
I am not the same
I can feel it come back home
So home
