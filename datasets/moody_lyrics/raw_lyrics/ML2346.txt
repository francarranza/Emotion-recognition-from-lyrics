You got to come back to me
I can't bare to spend my life alone
Just waiting on your ghost
And living without you
I'm afraid that wouldn't do
You have to believe me
I can't spend one night alone
Without your breath in my ear
I'm empty without it
And I'm afraid I couldn't live

Maybe there's a chance that I could carry on with your memory
Maybe there's a hope that I could live in the shell you left of me
Maybe I could last a while as the poster child for tragedy
I'm afraid that couldn't be

The silence is deafening
Must I face another day
Without the rhythm of your voice
That echoes inside me
It's a song I'll never sing

It's a thing I couldn't do
It's a thing I couldn't do
It's a thing I couldn't do

I afraid that couldn't be

I can't bear to spend my life
I can't bear to spend this life
I can't bear to spend my life alone
