I said a shake baby shake baby shake till the meat rolls off your bones
Shake baby shake baby shake till your mama and your papa come home
Shake baby shake I just love your sexy ways

Well upside down and all around baby don't be late let's bop the town
Come on baby shake baby come here baby come on baby
Come on baby I love your sexy ways now
Well grandpa he's too old to go he got a shake it just a little to the rock'n roll
So shake baby shake shake baby shake shake baby shake I love your sexy ways
Come on now...
