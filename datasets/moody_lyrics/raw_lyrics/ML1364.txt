I guess we've had our fun but it seems the fun is over now
And that's all right
It's all right
Time for me to move along and after all is said and done
I'll be all right
And it's all right

Tell me something that's sure to break my heart
'Cause everything's my fault
And I know I deserve to be alone
'Cause everything's my fault

Here we go again unsuccessful to make amends
And that's all right
And it's all right
I've tried as hard as I can
But again I can't seem to understand
Now it's all right
And it's all right

Tell me something that's sure to break my heart
'Cause everything's my fault
And I know I deserve to be alone
'Cause everything's my fault

I guess it's over now your honesty has all run out
But that's all right
And it's all right
I just can't seem to see how the hell you can make believe
That it's all right
And it's all right

Tell me something that's sure to break my heart
'Cause everything's my fault
And I know I deserve to be alone
'Cause everything's my fault
Everythings my fault
And everythings my fault (x2)
