There must be another way
When she's gone to a better place
And loneliness will hurt you if you can't get through the night
Then the moment starts to fade
And dawn is just an hour away
I feel she's watching over and it gets me through the night

It makes me wonder what you'd say
It's taking me back to the month of May
When I watched you do it (all night)
I'm thinking back to what we'd shared
In many ways I'm already there
And I watched you do it

Don't turn the lights on
Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark
Don't turn the lights on
Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark
Don't turn the lights on
Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark
Don't turn the lights on
Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark

Another walk to take
Another lonesome evening spent without you there
And only those who hurt you
Will say patience is a virtue
And it's been so long
And I can't think about it
No, I can't figure it out
'Cause just how real you're feeling
Every time that you're appearing
Leaves no room for doubt

It makes me wonder what you'd say
It's taking me back to the month of may
When I watched you do it (all night)
I'm thinking back to what we'd shared
In many ways I'm already there
And I watched you do it

Don't turn the lights on
Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark
Don't turn the lights on
Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark
Don't turn the lights on
Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark
Don't turn the lights on
Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark

Don't turn the lights on
Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark
Don't turn the lights on
Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark
Don't turn the lights on
Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark
Don't turn the lights on
Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark
