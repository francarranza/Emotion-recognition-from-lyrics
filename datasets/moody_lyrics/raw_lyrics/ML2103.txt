Girl when I look in your eyes
I don't want to more than friends
I just want to be
Oh when I look in your heart
I don't want to be more than anything but you and me
Girl when I look in your head
I don't want to see how it makes you feel to see me
Girl when I look in your heart
I don't want to be more than anything but you and me
It's a kind of cold heat
Moving down your old street
It's a kind of cold heat
Moving down your old street
Girl when I look in your eyes
I don't want to more than friends
I just want to be
Oh when I look in your heart
I don't want to be more than anything but you and me
Girl when I look in your head
I don't want to see how it makes you feel to see me
Girl when I look in your heart
I don't want to be more than anything but you and me
It's a kind of cold heat
Moving down your old street
It's a kind of cold heat
Moving down your old street
Girl when I look in your eyes
I don't want to more than friends
I just want to be
Oh when I look in your heart
I don't want to be more than anything but you and me
Girl when I look in your head
I don't want to see how it makes you feel to see me
Girl when I look in your heart
I don't want to be more than anything but you and me
