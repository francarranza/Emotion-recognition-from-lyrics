The Queen says no to pot-smoking FBI members

Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do

I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue 
I'm living every moment, girl, for you 

Walk, walk, cat, walk
Go, Johnny, go!
Same old twelve-bar blues

Elmore James got nothin' on this, baby!

I loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me, that's all you had to do
I feel it now, I hope you feel it too

Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I'm having the blues
