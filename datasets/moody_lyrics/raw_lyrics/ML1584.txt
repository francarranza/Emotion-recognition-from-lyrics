I know you well
You are a part of me
I know you better than I know myself

I know you best
Better than anyone
I know you better than I know myself

You are a part of me

You are just a part of me
You are just a part of me
You are just a part of me
You are just a part of me

Give it up

You don't speak
You don't judge
You can't leave
You can't hurt me
You're just here for me to use

I know you well, you are a part of me
I know you better than I know myself
I know you best, better than anyone
I know you better than I know myself
I know you well, better than one might think
I know you better than I know myself

I know you well, you are a part of me
I know you best, better than anyone
I know you well, you are a part of me
I know you best, better than one might think
It's time for you to make a sacrifice
It's time to die a little
Give it up

I know you best
Better than anyone
I know you better than I know myself

A part of me
