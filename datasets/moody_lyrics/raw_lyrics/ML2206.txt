Everything must change
Nothing stays the same
Everyone will change
No one stays the same

The young become the old
And mysteries unfold
'Cause that's the way of time
Nothing and no one goes unchanged

There are not many things in this life
That you can be sure of
Except the rain comes from the clouds
The sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds do fly

Winter turns to spring
A wounded heart will heal
But never much too soon
Yes, everything will change

'Cause there are not many things in this life
That you can be sure of
Except the rain comes from the clouds
The sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds do fly

Winter turns to spring
A wounded heart will heal
But never much too soon
Yes, everything must change

There are not many things in this life
That you can be sure of
Except the rain comes from the clouds
The sun lights up the sky

The rain comes from the clouds
The sun lights up the sky
The rain comes from the clouds
The sun lights up the sky
And music, sweet music, makes me cry

Everything will change
