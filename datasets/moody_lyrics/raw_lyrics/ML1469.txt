I wanna go to the sun
Hold my life like I've never done
But it's just the devil in me
The devil that's calling as I come undone

The sky is getting dark tonight
Darker then the fear that's gonna pull us apart
The beating is the sound of love
The sound of love is beating like a fevered heart
And it's the fire, the fire, the fire
It's heavenly, heavenly
Desire, desire
Desire, desire

I wanna lay in the dust
The dust is gonna fall here when I lie
God know it's just the devil in me
The devil that's taking my hand to the fire

I never wanna leave you now
Leave you like the sun is gonna disappear
But it's just believing now
Believing in my heart is what I've come to fear

And it's the fire, the fire, the fire
It's heavenly, heavenly
Desire, desire
Desire, desire
I've got desire, desire
I've got desire, desire

And only the lonly
Only the lonly fall
Only the lonly
Only the lonly fall
Fall

Oh, and I go to the fire
But God know the sound of, it's the sound of love
It's the beat of my heart that you
Finally beating, it's coming, coming, coming for you

And it's just the devil in me
It's just a door to the devil gathered in disguise
Taking me by the hand
And leading me, leading me off to the fire

And it's the fire, the fire, the fire
It's heavenly, heavenly
Desire, desire
Desire, desire

You don't have to be lost
(Desire, desire)
You don't have to be lost
(Desire, desire)
You don't have to be lost
(Desire, desire)
