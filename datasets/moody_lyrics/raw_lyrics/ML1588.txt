Your love means the world to me
Your love moves me tenderly
Words could not express the joy you bring
To have you by my side means everything... I sing
Your love has the best of me
If I could give you more then that would be...

Settle for my love, settle for my kiss
Settle for my love, that you'll never miss

So give to me, darling take my hand
Settle for my kiss
Settle for my love, that you'll never miss
'Cause it's all I can give

Like the ocean wide your love runs deep
Your love means the world to me
Like the birds outside my window sing
Your love... oh baby... moves me tenderly
Settle for my love, settle for my kiss

Settle for my love, that you'll never miss
So give to me, darling take my hand

Cause that's all I can give, baby
Settle for my kiss



Settle for my love, that you'll never miss
I can't bring you precious stars or paradise
All that I can give to you is love so true
And all these things are really on my mind

From the heart... ooh
Your love means the world to me (means the world)
Your love has the best of me
No words, no words, express the joy you bring
If I, if I could only give you everything... baby
Settle for my love, settle for my kiss

So give to me, dalring take my hand
Settle for my love, that you'll never miss

Cause that's all I can give, baby, yeah-yeah...
Settle for my kiss
Settle for my love, that you'll never miss

Settle for my love... settle for my love
Settle for my love... settle for my love
