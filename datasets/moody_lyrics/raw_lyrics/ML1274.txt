Hey, hey, hey
There is a joy in a sweet word that's been spoken
And the joy in a dream that's come true
There's a joy that I get when I'm watching you baby, hey
And the joy that I get watching the skies of blue
And then there's a joy, oh my darling, of a crying baby
And the joy of a child that's born to you
Then there's a joy of a beautiful lady
And the joy of the morning dew

It's something like the joy of loving you baby
Joy of dancing too
It's something like the joy of loving you baby, yeah
Joy of being with you, oh baby, oh baby

Oh my darling, I'll overcome the darkest nights
Just to see your love's alright
I've got a love to give, you know I love to live
There's something 'bout the joy of loving you baby
There's something 'bout the joy of loving you baby
There's something 'bout the joy of loving you baby

Joy, joy
Joy, joy
Joy, joy
Joy, joy
