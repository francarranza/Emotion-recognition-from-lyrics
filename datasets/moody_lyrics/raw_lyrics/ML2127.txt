Got to get a grip
Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity
If you think I'm vain, better shut ya lip
I can't explain how to be fat city
If you gotta live large, gotta let it rip

Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity
Don't cha gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip
Ya gotta have stones if you're living in the city
If ya wanna hang loose gotta get a grip rip

Once upon a crime I thought I was cool but I don't want to brag
Once I crossed the line I think I musta zigged when I shoulda zagged

Got to get a grip
Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity
If you think I'm vain, better shut ya lip
I can't explain how to be fat city
If you gotta live large, gotta let it rip

Same old same old every day if things don't change you're just gonna rot
'Cause if you do what you've always done you'll always get what you always got
Uh, could that be nothin'

Got to get a grip
Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity
If you think I'm vain, better shut ya lip
I can't explain how to be fat city
If you gotta live large, gotta let it rip

Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity
Don't cha gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip
Ya gotta have stones if you're living in the city
If ya wanna hang loose gotta get a grip, rip

Who knows for sure yeah without a doubt
What goes on when the lights go out
Or who pulls in when I pull out
And what's a one eyed trouser trout

I'm so short sighted
Now the wrong been righted
I feel so delighted
I get so excited

Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity
If you think I'm vain, better shut ya lip
I can't explain how to be fat city
If you gotta live large, gotta let it rip

Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity
Don't cha gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip
Ya gotta have stones if you're living in the city
If ya wanna hang loose gotta get a grip

Wanna get high in a New York minute
Choke that smoke, honey crack the whip
Your head gets dead
As long as you're in it
You wanna hang loose, gotta get a grip

Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity
Don't cha gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip
Ya gotta have stones if you're living in the city
If ya wanna hang loose gotta get a grip
