The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Number forty-seven said to number three


Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock
Rock, rock, r...

Sad Sack was a sittin' on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weepin' all alone
The warden said, 

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Shifty Henry said to Bugs, 
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, 

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
