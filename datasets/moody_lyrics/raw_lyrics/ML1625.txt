I am your sinking stone.
I'd rather be alone than drag you down and pick you up.
Haven't you been through enough?

I am the cruel one.
Don't know how I've become
A movie where the acting shows somebody you used to know.
You used to know.

Oh no.
I don't want to wake up feeling like I'm no one.
I don't want to wake up wondering how did I become the Cruel one.

It's quicker than you think.
Sadness spreads out like ink on the road and on the sea.
On the roof and balcony.

I was using loneliness and now it's using me.
There's nothing left to give to you.
One thing left to say to you.

I don't want to waste my time
Standing in a waiting line,
When I know what I want, and you're just what I want.
I don't want to waste my days, worrying what they'll say.
Now I know what I want, you're just what I want.
