I done ran into my baby
And finally found my old blue jean
I done ran into my baby
And finally found my old blue jean
Well, I could tell that they was mine
From the oil and the gasoline

If I ever get back my blue jean
Lord, how happy could one man be?
If I ever get back my blue jean
Lord, how happy could one man be?
'Cause if I get back those blue jeans
You know, my baby be bringin' 'em home to me
