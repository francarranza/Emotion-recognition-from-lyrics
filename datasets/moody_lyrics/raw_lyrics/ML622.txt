Last night I had a wonderful dream about a you
(Dream about you)
Last night I had a dream
(Hope that it will come true)

Last night I had a wonderful dream
I dreamed I held you in my arms
And you thrilled me with your charms

In a wonderful dream
I had last night
Your lips were oh so soft and warm
And a wonderful love was born

We were all alone
You told me that you care
And I never will forget
How happy I was that we were there

Last night I had a wonderful dream
And now that I'm alone with you
My wonderful dream will come true

Last night I had a wonderful dream about a you
(Dream about you)
Last night I had a dream
(Hope that it will come true)

We were all alone
You told me that you care
And I never will forget
How happy I was that we were there

Last night I had a wonderful dream
And now that I'm alone with you
My wonderful dream will come true

Please come true
Wonder, wonderful dream
Please come true.
