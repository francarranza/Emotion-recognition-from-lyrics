Give me something that I can believe
And then I'll share it with
The world for everyone to see
Take away the darkness, all the pain and sadness
I know it's you that put this light inside of me

I believe in a faith that's strong
And I believe in a hope that carries on
I believe in these things and more
Most of all, most of all
I believe in love

And if I had the strength to move a mountain
Would you be amazed by all of my abilities
I guess it would not mean
Much if I didn't have love
And this is what I really
Want you all to see

I believe in a faith that's strong
And I believe in a hope that carries on
I believe in these things and more
Most of all, most of all
I believe in love
I believe in love, oh
I believe in love
I believe in love, oh

I believe in a faith that's strong
And I believe in a hope that carries on
I believe in these things and more

I believe in a faith that's strong
And I believe in a hope that carries on
I believe in these things and more
Most of all, most of all
I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love
