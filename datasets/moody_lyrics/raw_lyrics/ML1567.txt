I always leave her waiting
I always leave her down
If she should come my way
I always turn around

Please don't tell her I love her
Please don't tell her I love her

I always keep her out
I never let her in
If she should come my way weeping
I greet her with a grin

Please don't tell her I love her
Please don't tell her I love her

If she should discover the colors of my love,
She will fly, fly away

Now you can try tenderness
You can try to hang around
Oh, but I'm sure she'll love you less,
I'm sure she'll bring you down

Please don't tell her I love her
Please don't tell her I love her
