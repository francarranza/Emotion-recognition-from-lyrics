The day's done
She won't listen
She won't listen
My head's numb
And I can't hear her
Any clearer

Cruise x8

My alien
He's still missing
He's still missing
My brain's numb
And I can't hear ya
Any clearer

Cruise x8

Wipe all the sweat from my eyes
And hide from the ocean!
Waves crush my flesh and skull;
But I still feel stupid... stupid... stupid...
Stupid!
Stupid!
Stupid!
Stupid!
