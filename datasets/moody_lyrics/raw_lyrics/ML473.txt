Hey, little girl, is your daddy home?
Did he go away and leave you all alone, mm-hmm?
I got a bad desire
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire

Tell me now, baby, is he good to you?
Can he do to you the things that I do, uh-huh?
I can take you higher
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull
And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my skull
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire
