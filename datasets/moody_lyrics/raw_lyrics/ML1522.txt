Didn't we break the silence
Didn't we fear the storm
Didn't we move the earth
Didn't we shoot for the sky
And didn't we catch the fire
And didn't we call upon the spirits
And didn't we fall together
And didn't we die for love

Days on the run
Nights in hiding
Hoping that you were
The healing inside me

Breathe in the sweet fire of love
- I'm not afraid anymore
Sweet, sweet fire
- I'm not alone
Breathe in the sweetest fire of love
- I'm not the same anymore
Sweet, sweet fire
- The sweet fire of love
The sweet fire of love

Didn't we cross new waters
Didn't we mix new blood
Didn't we build brand new bridges
Didn't we hold back the flood

Broken idols by the side of the road
They didn't fall on the side of the law
Here she comes a-shining like a light
Here she comes, salvation in the night

Days on the run
Nights in hiding
Hoping that you were
The healing inside me

Breathe in the sweet fire of love
- I'm not afraid anymore
Sweet, sweet fire
- I'm not alone
Breathe in the sweet fire of love
- I'm not the same anymore
Sweet, sweet fire
- The sweet fire of love
The sweet fire of love

Didn't we shine like silver
Didn't we bear the cross
Didn't we bring down the hammer
Didn't we beat on the drum

Days on the run
- Here she comes a-shining like a light
Nights in hiding
- Here she comes salvation in the night
Hoping that you were 
- I'm giving up the ghost
The healing inside me
- I'm giving up the ghost

Breathe in the sweet fire of love
- I'm not afraid anymore
Sweet, sweet fire
- I'm not alone
Breathe in the sweetest fire of love
- I'm not the same anymore
Sweet, sweet fire
- The sweet fire of love
The sweet fire of love

Fire of love
Fire of love
