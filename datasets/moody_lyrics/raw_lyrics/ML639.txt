I can't imagine to be like you
The pain and the suffering you put me through, woah
I can't imagine to be like you
The pain and the suffering you put me through

Don't tell me
I can't imagine to be like you
All the pain and the suffering I go through
You surround yourself with evil
Every night that you have is an equal


Or you'll live in your own hell
 You're surrounded by evil
 You can't get away
 Get out of my way, huh

The dark clouds that follow you
The rainy days will always find you
You can never get away
Evil comes another day


Or you'll live in your own hell
 You're surrounded by evil
 You can't get away

I can't imagine to be like you
The pain and the suffering you put me through, woah
I can't imagine to be like you
The pain and the suffering you put me through

Step up and
I can't imagine to be like you
All the pain and the suffering I go through
You surround yourself with evil
I hope it catches you up

I can't imagine to be like you
The pain and the suffering you put me through
I can't imagine to be like you
The pain and the suffering you put me through

I can't imagine to be like you
The pain and the suffering you put me through
I can't imagine to be like you
The pain and the suffering you put me through
