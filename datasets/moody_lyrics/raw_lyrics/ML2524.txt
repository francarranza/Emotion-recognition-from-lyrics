Time to search my soul
Now that I'm alone
And I need you

Lessons from the past
Say nothin' ever lasts
But I need you

This I know for sure
They'll never be a cure
So, give me somethin' for the pain
So, give me somethin' for the pain

Taking my world apart
It's written in my heart
That I need you

You'd been runnin' through my veins
Before I knew your name
And I need you

One thing I know for sure
They'll never be a cure
After findin' her love so pure
So, give me somethin' for the pain, yeah
Give me somethin' for the pain

One day I'll be a different me
And fly out an open door
Then I will be that day set free
And dream of you no more
Dream of you no more

One thing I know for sure
They'll never be a cure
After findin' her love so pure
So, give me somethin' for the pain
Give me somethin' for the pain
Give me somethin' for the pain
Give me somethin' for the pain
