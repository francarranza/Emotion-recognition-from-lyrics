Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick
And think of you
Caught up in circles 
Confusion is nothing new

Flashback to warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said

Then you say go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost
You can look 
And you will find me
Time after time

If you fall
I will catch you 
I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost
You can look 
And you will find me
Time after time

If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering If I'm OK

Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost
You can look 
And you will find me
Time after time

If you fall
I will catch you 
I'll be waiting
Time after time

You said go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost
You can look 
And you will find me
Time after time

If you fall
I will catch you 
I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost
You can look 
And you will find me
Time after time

If you fall
I will catch you 
I'll be waiting
Time after time
