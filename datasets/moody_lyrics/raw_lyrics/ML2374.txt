Six years strong and I'm still here, take life by the day
I know my path, conscience clear or in the ground I lay

Now, for my family
You know I'm sorry for the things you had to see
When I lost myself
My father said 'we will fight, won't let you die, son'

My sister found me almost dead, needle in my arm
I keep that picture in my head, I won't fall again

Now, for my family
You know I'm sorry for the things you had to see
When I lost myself
My father said 'we will fight, won't let you die'
My father said 'we will fight, won't let you die'

Break away from all the things in my life
That have held me down
Break away from all the things in my life
That have held me down

I don't hate myself - take away this pain
I don't hate myself - take away this pain
I don't hate myself - take away this pain
I don't hate myself

Won't bring back everything I ever was
Won't bring back everything I ever was
Won't bring back everything I ever was
Won't bring back everything I ever was

My father said 'we will fight, won't let you die'
My father said 'we will fight, won't let you die'

Won't bring back everything I ever was (x8)
Won't bring back'
