I get all numb
When she sings it's over
Such a strange numb
And it brings my knees to the earth

And God bless you all
For the song you saved us

You're the same numb
When you sing it's over
Such a strange numb
It could bring back peace to the earth

So God bless you all
For the song you saved us
For the hearts you break
Every time you moan

I get all numb
We're the same numb
And it brings our knees to the earth

So God bless you all
For the song you saved us
For the hearts you break
Every time you moan
And God bless you all on the earth
