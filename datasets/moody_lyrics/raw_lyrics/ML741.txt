I'm a stranger in town and my gun's never cold
I'm a gambler so bet on your life 
You'll never live to grow old
I deal in lead I won't step aside
Where trouble's waitin' well so am I
I live for the fight the thrill of the kill
Paid in gold for the blood I spill

Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the west a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride

The law of the west was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast lives on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw
Live by the gun or die by the law

Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the west a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
Shot trough the heart in the blink of an eye
Buried up on boot hill
Life is cheap when the bounty is high
So be ready to kill

The law of the west was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast lives on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw
Live by the gun or die by the law
Shot of whiskey I'll be on my way
Back in the saddle pull on the reins
Spurs to the beast over the hill
Another town one more kill

Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the west a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
