Let's do this

Faking falls, stop and stall, take it all
Fact is I'm taking mine, I'm taking mine
Time is up, out of luck
Should've stood up when you had the time
But you're out of time

Let's do this, fight, fight, fight, fight
Lock and load, rock and roll
Bitch, it's all over, you're going down
You're going down

Get ready to settle the score
And get ready to face the floor
'Cause it's time to remember it
War

This is war and it's on tonight
So get up and fight, get up and fight
You've had all your life to run and hide
Now step up, now step up, let's do this

Sat around, going down
How about a little reaction, man?
You can barely stand
Bitch slap, slow attack
Man, that was practically suicide
Next in line

Go, fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight

Get ready to settle the score
And get ready to face the floor
'Cause it's time to remember it
War

This is war and it's on tonight
So get up and fight, get up and fight
You've had all your life to run and hide
Now step up, now step up, let's do this

'Cause we're all about ready to break
And we're all about ready to break
Yeah, we're all about ready to break
Yeah, we're all about ready to break

This is war and it never ends
So get up, get up, get up, get up
You've had all your life to run and hide
Step up, now step up

This is war and it never ends
This is war and it never ends
This is war

Let's do this, let's do this
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight
Let's do this
