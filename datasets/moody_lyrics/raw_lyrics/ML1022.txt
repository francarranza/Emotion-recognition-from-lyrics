No fun my babe, no fun
No fun my babe, no fun
No fun to hang around
Feelin' that same old way
No fun to hang around
Freaked out for another day

No fun my babe, no fun
No fun my babe, no fun
No fun to be alone
Walking by myself
No fun to be alone
In love with nobody else

Well, maybe go out, maybe stay home
Maybe call mom on the telephone

Well come on, well come on
Well come on, well come on
Well come on, well come on
Well come on, well come on

No fun to be alone
No fun to be alone
Hang on, don't you let me go
No fun to be alone
I said to be alone
I said to be alone
No fun

When I say, when I say come on around, I say
I say come on around
I say come on around let me
I say come on around let me hear you tell 'em
Let here you tell 'em how I
Tell me how I, tell me how I
Tell me how I, tell me how I
Tell me how I feel
I say, I say I wanna hear you tell 'em how I feel
Yeah, yeah

Well come on
Well come on
Well come on
Well come on
Well come on
Well come on

I thought I, thought I, thought I
I thought I, I thought I
I thought I, ah
Well come on, yeah

Yeah, my man
I thought I, I thought, I thought
After we say it, come on
After we say it, come on
After we say it, come on
