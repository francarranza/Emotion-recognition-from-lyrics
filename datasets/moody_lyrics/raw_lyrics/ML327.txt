I feel the sun, it's returned again
To chase the cold far away
I'm not alone to fight the world I'm in
You gave me hope for better days

I was searching for a friend like no other
I never thought You'd come my way

Everything I give to You
I'll love You so
Everything I say or do
I'll love You so

Look where we've come, how could I ever forget
Before Your love my heart was dead?
I was afraid that my sun would set
But You stayed around to lift my head

I was living my whole life undercover
I never dreamed I'd see Your face

Everything I give to You
I'll love You so
And everything I say or do
I'll love You so

Ooh, I'll love You so
Ooh, I'll love You so

Everything I give to You
I'll let it go
Everything I say or do
I'll love You so

Ooh, I'll love You so
Ooh, I'll love You so

(Ooh, I feel the sun)
I'll love You so
I feel the sun
