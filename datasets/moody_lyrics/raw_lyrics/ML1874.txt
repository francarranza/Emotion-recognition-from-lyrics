Dancing in the living room, cutting up a rug
Dancing with the baby looks more like a hug
Living in a house made of sawmill wood
Rollover Beethoven never sounded so good

So come on baby, baby let's go
Where we get the money honey I don't know
But one more baby's all right by me
We'll just add another limb to the family tree

Well raising up babies is our new sport
You're one day late and I'm a dollar short
Now maybe it was planned and maybe it was a goof
But a cat's just gotta dance on a hot tin roof

Yeah come on baby, baby let's go
Where we get the money honey I don't know
But one more baby's all right by me
We'll just add another limb to the family tree

Well the lawnmower's broke and the tax is due
And if I find another tick I'm gonna come unglued
We got hand-me down clothes and hand-me down shoes
We got the big belly momma-here-we-go-again blues

Hey hey baby, baby let's go
Where we get the money honey I don't know
But one more baby's all right by me
We'll just add another limb to the family tree

Baby, whoa
Where we get the money, hell I don't know
One more baby's all right by me
It's all right
It's all right now baby
We'll just add another limb to the family tree
Well just add another limb baby

We'll just add another limb to the family tree
