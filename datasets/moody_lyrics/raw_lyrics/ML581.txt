I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself,
What a wonderful world

I see sky of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day the dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colours of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
I also and the faces by people passing by
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do?
They're really saying I love you

I hear babies cry, they watch them grow
They learn much more, they'll never know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Yes I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I see friends shaking hands
Saying how do you do?
They're really saying I love you

I hear babies cry
They watch them grow
They learn much more
They'll never know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Yes I think to myself
What a wonderful world.
