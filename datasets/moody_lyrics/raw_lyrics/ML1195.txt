I don't know
How I survived
In this cold and empty world 
For all this time
I only know
That I'm alive
Because you love me

When I recall
What I've been through
There's some things
That I wish I didn't do
Now I do the things I do
Because you love me

And now that you're in my life
I'm so glad I'm alive
'Cause you showed me the way
And I know now how good it can be
Because you love me

Oh and now that you're in my life
Oh I'm so glad I'm alive
'Cause you showed me the way
And I know now how good it can be
Because you love me

I believe in things unseen 
I believe in the message of a dream
And I believe in what you are
Because you love me

With all my heart
And all my soul
I'm loving you
And I never will let go
And every day I'll let it show
Because you love me
Because you love me
Because you love me
