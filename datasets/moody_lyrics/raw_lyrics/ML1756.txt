It's so relieving
To know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid

It's so relaxing
To hear that you're asking
Wherever you get your way

It's so soothing
To know that you'll sue me
Starting to sound the same

I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
Hey, ooh

In her false witness
We hope you're still with us
To see if they float or drown

Our favorite patient
Display of patience
Disease-covered Puget Sound

She'll come back as fire
To burn all the liars
Leave a blanket of ash on the ground

I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
Hey, ooh

It's so relieving
To know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid

It's so relaxing
To know that you're asking
Wherever you get your way

It's so soothing
To know that you'll sue me
Starting to sound the same

I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
Hey, ooh
