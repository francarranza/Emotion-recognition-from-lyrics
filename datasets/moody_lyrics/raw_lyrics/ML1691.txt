(Love, love, love)
All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys,
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love, yes, it's real love
Oh it's real love, yes it's real love

From this moment on I'll know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid
It's real love, yes it's real love
Oh it's real love, yes it's real love

Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love, yes it's real love
Oh it's real love, yes it's real love (repeat)
