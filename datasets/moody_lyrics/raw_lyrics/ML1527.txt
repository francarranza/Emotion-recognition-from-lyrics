And you know I can't hold on
'Cause I can't miss you while you're gone
All this years I've cried and you know I've tried
You never lived out the way that you like

And I know your darkness deep inside
Walk away from the hurt that you left behind
I'll let the rain wash away the regret
I don't need you to help me forget

If you walk I'll don't look back
Don't never be at what we had
And I'm not sorry, but I can't forget
You left me bitter 'bout the things you said

And I know your darkness deep inside
Walk away from the hurt that you left behind
I'll let the rain wash away the regret
I don't need you to help me forget

And you know I can't hold on
'Cause I can't miss you while you're gone
All this years I've cried and you know I've tried
You never lived out the way that you like

And I know your darkness deep inside
Walk away from the hurt that you left behind
I'll let the rain wash away the regret
I don't need you to help me forget

If you walk I'll don't look back
Don't never be at what we had
And I'm not sorry, but I can't forget
You left me bitter 'bout the things you said

And I know your darkness deep inside
Walk away from the hurt that you left behind
I'll let the rain wash away the regret
I don't need you to help me forget
