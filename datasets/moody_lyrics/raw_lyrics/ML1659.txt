I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on

I've traveled around this country crossed the waters deep and wide
Made lots of friends and memories brought joy to other's lives
It's Christmas time again another year has come and gone
And I can't keep from wonderin' how the old folks are at home

I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on

When the snow is on the meadow and the sleigh bells jingle bright
And the kids are singing jingle bells around the Christmas lights
As daddy stokes the fire and mama puts the turkey on
There ain't nothing going to slow me down this Christmas I'll be home

I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on

I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on
