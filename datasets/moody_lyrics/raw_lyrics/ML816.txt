Come the war
Come the avarice
Come the war
Come hell

Come attrition
Come the reek of bones
Come attrition
Come hell

And this is why
Why we fight
Why we lie awake
And this is why
This is why we fight

And when we die
We will die
With our arms unbound
And this is why
This is why we fight
Come hell

Bride of quiet
Bride of all unquiet things
Bride of quiet
Bride of hell

Come the archers
Come the infantry
Come the archers
Of hell

And this is why
Why we fight
Why we lie awake
And this is why
This is why we fight

And when we die
We will die
With our arms unbound
And this is why
This is why we fight
Come hell
Come hell

And this is why
Why we fight
Why we lie awake
And this is why
This is why we fight

And when we die
We will die
With our arms unbound
And this is why
This is why we fight

So come to me
Come to me now
Lay your arms around me
And this is why
This is why we fight

Come hell
Come hell
Come hell
Come hell
