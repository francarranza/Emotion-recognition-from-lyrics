Welcome to the abandoned land
Come on in, child, take my hand
Here there's no work or play
Only one bill to pay
There's just five words to say
As you go down, down, down

You're gonna burn in hell
Oh, burn in hell

You can't believe all the things I've done wrong in my life
Without even trying I've lived on the edge of a knife
Well, I've played with fire, but I don't want to get myself burned
To thine own self be true, so I think that it's time for a change

Before I burn in hell
Oh, burn in hell

Take a good look in your heart, tell me what do you see?
It's black and it's dark, now is that how you want it to be?
It's up to you, what you do will decide your own fate
Make your choice now for tomorrow may be far too late

Hear no evil, don't you
See no evil, don't you
Lay no evil down on me
Speak no evil, don't you
Think no evil don't you
Play with evil, 'cause I'm free

And then you'll burn in hell

You're gonna burn in hell
Oh, burn in hell
