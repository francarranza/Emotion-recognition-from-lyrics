Want you to stay in a subtle way
Like I'm walking again, all on me
Step slowly, you know that you fall between
Dark places, what a simple web we weave

We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in
We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in

Know my soul
Know my soul
Well, all hail
Prison queen
Iron bars
Iron heart
Iron bars
Everything

A hundred years old
A hundred years old

Last on the village scene
Fall apart
Iron heart
More alive than you've ever been

We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in
We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in

Well, it's a dull life
It's a dull life
It's a dull life
It's a dark place
It's a dull life
It's a dull life
It's a dull life
It's a dull life

Know my soul

We've seen the nightmare of your lies
We've seen the nightmare of your lies
We've seen the nightmare of your lies
We've seen the nightmare of your lies
We've seen the nightmare of your lies
We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in
We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in

Know my soul
