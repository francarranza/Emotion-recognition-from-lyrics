I saw you starin' at each other
I saw your eyes begin to glow
And I could tell you once were lovers
But you ain't hidin' nothin' that I don't know.

There's an old flame burnin' in your eyes
That tears can't drown and make-up can't disguise
Now that old flame might not be stronger
But it's been burnin' longer
Than any spark I might have started in your eyes.

You said it ended when he left you
You say your love for me is strong
But those old memories still upset you
Well, I might be a memory before too long.

'Cause there's an old flame burnin' in your eyes
That tears can't drown and make-up can't disguise
Now that old flame might not be stronger
But it's been burnin' longer
Than any spark I might have started in your eyes.

There's an old flame burnin' in your eyes
That tears can't drown and make-up can't disguise
Now that old flame might not be stronger
But it's been burnin' longer...
