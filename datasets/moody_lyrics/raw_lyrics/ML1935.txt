Lord knows I've tried
To do what's right
One whole year of stayin' home
Both day and night

'Cause I smell a mean trouble
Way over yonder
You know I heard a mean, yeah
Always in trouble people
Lord they just won't let me be

The people talk about me
Both night and day
I said, Lord please forgive them
And go the other way

'Cause I smell a mean trouble
Lord I smell trouble
Ahead of me, oh yeah
Yes, always in trouble

Lord, they just won't let me be
And from now on
I will not run and hide
I'll face trouble with a smile
And hope it pass me by

'Cause I smell a mean trouble
Way over yonder
I say I heard a mean
Yes, always in trouble

They just won't
They just won't
Lord, they just won't
Let me be

Hoo, oh yeah
