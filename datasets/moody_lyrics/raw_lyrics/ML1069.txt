All alone, on my knees I pray
For the strength to stay away
In and out, out and in you go
I feel your fire
Then I lose my self-control

How can I ease the pain
When I know you're coming back again
And how can I ease the pain in my heart

How can I ease the pain
When I know you're coming back again
And how can I ease the pain in my heart
How can I ease the pain

Everytime that I let you in
You take away something deep within
A fool for love is a fool for pain
But I refuse to love you again

How can I ease the pain
When I know you're coming back again
And how can I ease the pain in my heart

How can I ease the pain
When I know you're coming back again
And how can I ease the pain in my heart
How can I ease the pain

If it's not love you've come here for
Tell me baby why you're here?
Knock, knock, knockin' at my door
I can't take it, no more
No more, no more, no more baby
Give me all or nothing at all

How can I ease the pain
When I know you're coming back again
And how can I ease the pain in my heart

How can I ease the pain
When I know you're coming back again
And how can I ease the pain in my heart

I need to know how
How can I, ease it
Ooh, how can I ease the pain
I need to know baby
Ooh, how can I ease the pain
I need to know how to ease it
How can I ease the pain
