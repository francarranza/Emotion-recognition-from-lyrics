You know you ought to slow down
You been working too hard
And that's a fact
Sit back and relax a while
Take some time to laugh and smile
Lay your heavy load down

All the things we want to, yeah

The love I feel for you
You feel for me
One life is all we have to live
Our love is all we have to give, yeah
There are so many things
For us to do and see
Let's take some time to be alone
Lock the door
Pull out the phone, yeah

And baby we can do it
Take the time
Do it right
We can do it, baby
Do it tonight

Baby, we can do it
