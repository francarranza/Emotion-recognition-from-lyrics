Bruised But Not Broken
Been a lot that I've been through
I've cried a tear a time or two, baby
You know I cried some over you
Had my heart kicked to the ground
Love ripped me up and tore me down, baby
But that ain't enough to break me
'Cause I'll rise above it
And I'll pick myself up
And I'll dust the pain off my heart

And I'll be all right
And I'll love again
And the wounds will mend
I'm bruised but not broken
And the pain will fade
I'll get back on my feet
It's not the end of me
My heart is still open
I'm bruised but not broken

Been a lot of tears stained nights
I thought the tears were here for life, baby
The hurt came on and held on tight, yeah
I took a chance, I took a fall
Love broke my heart and shattered all my dreams
But I won't be down on my knees
'Cause I'll rise above it
And I'll pick myself up
And I'll shake the rain out of my heart


And I'll be all right
And I'll love again
And the wounds will mend
I'm bruised but not broken
And the pain will fade
I'll get back on my feet
It's not the end of me
My heart is still open
I'm bruised but not broken

Gonna pick my heart up
Take my life back
Shake the hurt away
Pull myself together, put the pieces back in place
I learned love's so hard
Love left my soul scarred
I was shattered inside

And I'll be all right
And I'll love again
And the wounds will mend
I'm bruised but not broken
And the pain will fade
I'll get back on my feet
It's not the end of me
My heart is still open
I'm bruised but not broken
