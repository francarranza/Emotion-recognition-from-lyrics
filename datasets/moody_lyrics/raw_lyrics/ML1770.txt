Wake me up with laughter
Wrap me in your arms
This ain't no morning after
It's never been so warm

It didn't take so long
For us to feel this way
Can a good thing last
Longer than a day?

Where do we take it now
Now that we caught fire?
Will something greater grow
Out of this desire?

Should I drop my guard
At the risk of being used?
But the way you do those things to me
How can I refuse?

I could get addicted
To your energy
The way you take me over
Mmm, keeps pulling on me

Our hearts beat together
Our timing is the same
But can I trust my feelings
And save myself the pain?

Where do we take it now
Now that we caught fire?
Will something greater grow
Out of this desire?

Should I drop my guard
At the risk of being used?
But the way you do those things to me
How can I refuse?

We could share the mystery
And spare ourselves the misery
Discover it again every day
We could take love all the way

Where do we take it now
Now that we caught fire?
Will something greater grow
Out of this desire?

Should I drop my guard 
At the risk of being used?
But the way you do those things to me
How can I refuse?
