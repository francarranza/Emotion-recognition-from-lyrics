It's time to play the game
Time to play the game
Hahahaha

Hahaha

It's all about the game and how you play it
All about control and if you can take it
All about your debt and if you can pay it
It's all about pain and who's gonna make it
I am the game, you don't wanna play me
I am control, no way you can change me
I am heavy debt, no way you can pay me
I am the pain and I know you can't take me

Look over your shoulder, ready to run
Like a craven bitch from a smoking gun
I am the game and I make the rules
So move on out or you die like a fool
Try to figure out what my move's gonna be
Come on over, sucker, why don't you ask me?
Don't you forget there's a price you can pay
'Cause I am the game and I want to play

It's time to play the game
Hahaha
Time to play the game

It's all about the game and how you play it
It's all about control and if you can take it
It's all about your debt and if you can pay it
It's all about the pain and who's gonna make it
I am the game, you don't wanna play me
I am control, there's no way you can change me
I am your debt and you know you can't pay me
I am your pain and I know you can't take me

Play the game
You're gonna be the same
You're gonna change your name
You're gonna die in flames

Hahaha
Time to play them game
It's time to play the game
It's time to play the game
It's time to play the game
Hahaha
Time to play the game
Hahahaha
