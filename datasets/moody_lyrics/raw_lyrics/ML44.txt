Ever feel like dying?
Ever feel alone?
Ever feel like crying?
Lost child in a store
Ever feel life pushing?
Shoving you away
Ever feel like breaking down?
Funeral in the rain

Feel like slipping away

Stand in the corner and scream with me
A body full of empty
A head that's full of rage - Better believe it
Stand in the closet and scream with me
A mind that's like a fire
Driven by the pain - Better believe it

Ever feel like lying?
Down inside a grave
Listen to the eulogy
A pyre of the hay
Ever danced beside the devil?
Taste the barrel of a gauge
Ever pulled the trigger?
The light begins to fade

Feel life slipping away

Stand in the corner and scream with me
A body full of empty
A head that's full of rage - Better believe it,
Stand in the closet and scream with me
A mind that's like a fire
Driven by the pain - Better believe it

I've asked you for forgiveness
I've asked you for your grace
I've asked you for your blessing
I've asked that I be saved

Stand in the corner and scream with me
A body full of empty
A head that's full of rage - Better believe it

Stand in the corner and scream with me
A body full of empty
A head that's full of rage - Better believe it,
Stand in the closet and scream with me
A mind that's like a fire
Driven by the pain - Better believe it

Stand in the corner and scream with me
A body full of empty
A head that's full of rage - Better believe it
Driven by the pain - Better believe it
