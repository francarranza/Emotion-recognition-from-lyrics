He made it come together
Put your hand on me
And I feel it mama
He made a blind man see
Been sleepwalking
An eternity

Whoa yes

I'm working on a new plain
Working on Sunday Morning
Working on being forgiven
For all that hard living

I've been steamrolling
Heading for a crash
Cruise controlling
Blowing right on past
Sleepwalking
Put your hand on me

I'm working on a new plain
Working on Sunday morning
Working on being forgiven
For all that hard living

And I'm not the only one
Who been happy to receive
Do you hear them call your name
Carrying a heavy load
When the bullets that protect you

Come raining down on your own head
Your feeling like your almost blind
Carrying a heavy load
Carrying a heavy load
Oh, no

Don't cry mama
Gonna be ok
So sorry
That it went that way
Like a stray sheep
And then you called on me

I'm working on a new plain
I'm working on a Sunday morning
Working on being forgiven
For all that hard living
Working on a Sunday morning
Working on being forgiven
For all that hard living

I'm working on a new plain

I'm working on a new plain
Feel like I'm being forgiven
For all that hard, hard, hard living
Hard living
