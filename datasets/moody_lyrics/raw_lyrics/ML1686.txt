Happy Holiday
Happy holiday,

While the merry bells keep ringing
May your every wish come true

Happy holiday, happy holiday
May the calendar keep bringing
Happy holidays to you

(If your burdened down with trouble)
(If your nerves a wearing thin)
(Park your load down the road)
(And come to Holiday Inn)

If the traffic noise affects you
Like a squeaky violin
Kick your cares down the stairs
Come to Holiday Inn

(If you can't find someone who)
(Will set your heart a-whirl)
(Take your car and motor to)
(The home of boy meets girl)

If you're laid-up with a breakdown
Throw away your vitamin
(Don't get worse), grab your nurse
And come to Holiday Inn

(Happy holiday, happy holiday) 
(While the merry bells are ringin')
(May your every wish come true)

(Happy holiday, happy holiday)
(May the calendar keep bringin')
(Happy holidays to you)

Happy holiday, happy holiday)
While the merry bells keep ringin'
May your every wish come true

Happy holiday, happy holiday
May the calendar keep bringin'
Happy holidays to you.
