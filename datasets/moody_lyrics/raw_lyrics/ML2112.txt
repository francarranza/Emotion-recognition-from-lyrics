Ooh

Hey you say you want to start over again
Like I ever wanted it to be any different
I've been watching all your colours fade to blue
Said you'd come back like I'd want you want you
Stop pretending everything's all right

Oh baby blue oh baby blue
Come here I'm gonna smear another colour over you
Get out of bed you little sleepy head
Your black and white needs a little bit of red
Your black and white needs a little bit of red

Ooh

Couldn't handle pressure like I put you through
Thought you might have bit off a little more than you could chew
No I don't believe it when you say I will make it up to you
Said you'd come back didn't want you to want you to
Still pretending everything's all right

Baby blue oh
Baby blue oh
