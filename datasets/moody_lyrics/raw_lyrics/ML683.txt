Southern girl don't you know ya good to me and I dig you so
I wouldn't be right here if you hadn't been right there
Southern girl your the one lots of lovin' lots of fun
The tenderness you give me I wanna take it everywhere
I wasn't happy not at all
You were the first to hear my call
Your hospitality shows me that you care

Below the mason dixon line down there where the girls are fine
Sure know how to treat me you just make me feel so good
Southern girl here's to you no one can do it like you do
Girl you be so sweet I just always knew you would
Girl you love me from the start from the bottom of your heart
Came along a heard my song

Southern girl southern girl
Southern girl southern girl
Girl you keep me satisfided
Always right there by my side
Girl there's one thing you should know
That I really dig you so

Southern girl don't you know ya good to me and I dig you so
I wouldn't be right here if you hadn't been right there
Southern girl southern girl
Southern girl southern girl
