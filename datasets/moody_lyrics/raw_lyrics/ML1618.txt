Every day was filled with all the love and happiness
I could find in my life
There was nothing I could miss
It was easy
Easy

I had found the one before
I even knew her name
I was sure that when she left me
I would never feel the same
It was easy
Easy

What did I get myself into
I didn't realize the compromise
I put you through What did
I get myself into
And tell me how to get back into you

Now the reason for the complication's all because of me
I was sure it'd last forever
But I guess
I was na√Øve
It was easy
Easy

If I was the man, that I make myself to be
I would understand what understanding really means
If you could find it in your heart
To see what I'm going through
