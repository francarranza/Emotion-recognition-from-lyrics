I hear the words of the rasta man say
Babylon your throne gone down, gone down
Babylon your throne gone down

Said, I hear the words of the higher man say
Babylon your throne gone down, gone down
Babylon your throne gone down

And I hear the angel with the seven seals
Babylon your throne's gone down, gone down
Babylon your throne gone down

I say fly away home to zion, fly away home
I say fly away to zion, fly away home
One bright morning when my work is over
Man will fly away home

One bright morning when my work is over
Man will fly away home
One brlght morning when my work is over
Man will fly away home

I say fly away home to zion, fly away home
I say fly away to zion, fly away home
One bright morning when my work is over
Man will fly away home
