Somebody help me

Somebody help me
Find my baby right now

I'm looking for a love
I'm looking for a love
I'm looking here and there
I'm searching everywhere
I'm looking for a love
To call my own

Gonna get up in the morning
And rub my head
I'm looking for a love
To call my own

Fix my breakfast
And bring it to my bed
I'm looking for a love
To call my own

Do my love
Do it all the time
I'm looking for a love
To call my own

With lots of love and kisses
But people until then
I'm looking for a love
To call my own

I'm looking for a love
I'm looking for a love
I'm looking here and there
I'm searching everywhere
I'm looking for a love
To call my own

Stay in my corner
All the way, yeah
I'm looking for a love
To call my own

Stick by me, baby
No matter what they say
I'm looking for a love
To call my own

I'll give my love
To her all the time
I'm looking for a love
To call my own

Loving, kissing
People on the way
I'm looking for a love
To call my own

I'm looking for a love
I'm looking for a love
I'm looking here and there
I'm searching everywhere
I'm looking for a love
To call my own

Somebody help me
To find my baby
I said I've got to find
My baby right now

I'm looking in the morning
I'm looking at night
Got to find my baby
But she's nowhere in sight

Somebody help me
To find my baby
I said I've got to find
My baby right now

I'm looking in the morning
I'm looking at night
Got to find my baby
She's nowhere in sight

I'm looking, I'm looking
I'm looking, I'm looking...
