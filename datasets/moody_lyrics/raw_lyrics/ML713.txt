Ain't it just like one of us
To pick up the phone and call after a couple drinks
And say how you been, I've been wondering if
Maybe you've been thinkin' about me
And somewhere in the conversation
An old familiar invitation always arrives
I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight

Everyone's known someone that they
Just can't help but want
Even though we just can't make it work out
The want to, lingers on
So once again, we wind up in each other's arms
Pretending that it's right
And I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight

I know it's wrong, but it ain't easy movin' on
So why can't two friends
Remember the good times once again

Tomorrow when I wake up
I'll be feelin' a little guilty, a little sad
Thinkin' how it used to be before everything went bad
I guess that's what it is
All lonely, late night calls, that we try to find
I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight
I may hate msyelf in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight
