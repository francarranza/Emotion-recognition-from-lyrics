Offended by my obscenity
Mouth full of soap
Cleansing me
Asking for a little empathy
Mouth is stained please let me
Breathe
Don't breathe, don't breathe
I can't breathe
Breathe
Don't breathe, don't breathe
I can't breathe
I am suffocating
I am suffocating
I am suffocating
I am so frustrated
Drowning in my insecurity
I am on my hands and knees
Begging for a little symapthy
Begging you to help me
Breathe
Don't breathe, don't breathe
I can't breathe
Breathe
Don't breathe, don't breathe
I can't breathe
I am suffocating
I am suffocating
I am suffocating
I am so frustrated
