Black top letters written out of chalk
That she might see me when school is over
Dripping thoughts fall onto the sidewalk
I could only tell you when I'm not sober

Ooh, it's not your fault, it's not your fault
It's not your fault, it's not your fault
Ooh, it's not your fault, it's not your fault
It's not your fault, it's not your fault, ooh-ooh

Cryptic message written in the dark
All that haunts me is surely closure
Locking hands floating through the park
They always watch me losing composure

Ooh, it's not your fault, it's not your fault
It's not your fault, it's not your fault
Ooh, it's not your fault, it's not your fault
It's not your fault, it's not your fault
Ooh, it's not your fault, it's not your fault
It's not your fault, it's not your fault
Ooh, it's not your fault, it's not your fault
It's not your fault, it's not your fault
