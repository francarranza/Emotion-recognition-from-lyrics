I just can't work it out
I want to be with you now
I've got to get it right
I never wanted to fight 

And it's hard to know what you want
And it's hard to say what you've got
And it's hard to know what you want
And it's hard to say what you've got

I just can't work it out
I want to be with you now
I've got to get it right
I never wanted to fight 

And it's hard to know what you want
'Cause it's hard to say what you've got
And it's hard to know what you want
'Cause it's hard to say what you've got

People can do the most amazing of things
