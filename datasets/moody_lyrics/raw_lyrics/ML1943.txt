There's someone down below blowing you a kiss
They watch from their windows
As all arms fall to their sides, and all eyes fix
On the death of tomorrow

And you found everything you need
To make a life complete
Completely revolting, and they have safety and relief
For sale up the street
I see you in line everyday

You had time to waste and I'm not sorry
Such a basket case, hide the cutlery
I had time to kill, it's dead and buried
You've got guts to spill, but no one trustworthy

These creatures are waking up in these dark trees
Waiting like vultures
Eyes roll back, turn white in time to feed
They salivate in hunger

For you and everything they need
To make a death complete
Completely unnatural and salvation lies
Behind those dead eyes
That watch you while you sleep every night

And you had time to waste and I'm not sorry
Such a basket case, hide the cutlery
I had time to kill its dead and buried
You've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy

You had time to waste and I'm not sorry
Such a basket case, hide the cutlery
I had time to kill its dead and buried
You've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy
