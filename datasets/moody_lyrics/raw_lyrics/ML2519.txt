Woman, when I saw you comin'
Should've started runnin'
Evil woman

Woman, I offered to you my soul
You ran it over hot coals
You evil woman

Woman, thought you were a blessin'
Then I caught you messin'
Evil woman

Woman, you ain't got no feelin'
You're just a dirty dealin'
Yeah

Evil woman, the Lord's gonna' rack up 
Evil woman, the Lord's gonna' beckon you
Evil woman, can't you see where you're fallin'
Evil woman, the devil is a-callin' 
Evil woman, the Lord's gonna' rack up 
Evil woman, the Lord's gonna' beckon you
Evil woman, can't you see where you're fallin'
Evil woman, the devil is a-callin' you

Woman, when you whisper to me
All the hurt you do me
Evil woman

Woman, the way you went your way
Gettin' under my skin
You evil woman!

Woman, when you laugh at my pain
When you step on my brain, yeah!
Evil woman

Woman, if there were other choices
How I didn't hear the voices - Cryin' 

Evil woman, the Lord's gonna' rack up 
Evil woman, the Lord's gonna' beckon you
Evil woman, can't you see where you're fallin' 
Evil woman, the devil is a-callin' 
Evil woman, the Lord's gonna' rack up 
Evil woman, the Lord's gonna' beckon you
Evil woman, can't you see where you're fallin' 
Evil woman, the devil is a-callin' you 

Woman, when you whisper to me
All the hurt you do me
Evil woman

Woman, the way you went your way
Gettin' under my skin
You evil woman

Woman, when you laugh at my pain
When you step on my brain
Evil woman

How I didn't hear the voices
