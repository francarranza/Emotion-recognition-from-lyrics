When the morning comes
Like shifting sands
In a desert storm
Like a raging fire
Heats up the big sky baby
Your love is pure and strong
Chained to your heart I surrender
Here's where I belong

And If I get emotional and I'm restless
You're like a soothing ray of light
Bring to me to my senses in a heart beat darling
Hold me tender in the night

Tell me what miracles are made of
Like the sweet soft morning dew
How can I ever show you baby
How can I prove it all to you

That I'm a woman in love
I'm a woman in love
I'm a woman in love
I'm a woman in love

I get so mixed up and tongue tied
I can hardly say my name
Bring to me to my senses in a heart beat darling
Hold me tender in the night

'Cause I'm a woman in love
I'm a woman in love
I'm a woman in love
I'm a woman in love

Never thought this would
Never thought this would
Never thought this would happen to me

Never thought this would
Never thought this would
Never thought this would happen to me

I'm a woman in love
I'm a woman in love
I'm a woman in love
I'm a woman in love
