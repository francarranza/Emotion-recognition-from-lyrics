What you want
You are, you always were
What you want
You are, you always were

When the plans fall
Changing hands
What are the chances
Of winning?

You, you hold my heart
You, you won't let up
After when I'm called
Touch turns into fisticuffs
It's all in your head
Wonder if I'm fixed to cut

For its statistics
In the collected whole
We are the hunger
That keeps you climbing walls

It's the one thing
You can count on
We all end floating away
We all end floating away

You, you hold my heart
You, you won't let up
After when I'm called
Touch turns into fisticuffs
It's all in your head
Wonder if I'm fixed to cut

Is it your fault?
Is it your fault?
Is it your fault?
Is it your fault?
Is it your fault?
Is it your fault?
Is it your fault?
Is it your fault?

You
You're sinking, so they say
You
You're finished, so they say
You
You're buried, so they say
You
I care when caring fades
