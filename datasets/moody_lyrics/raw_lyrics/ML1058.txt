It's a love thing
It's a love thing
(It's a love thing, thing)

The look in your eyes is more than enough
To make my poor heart burst into flames
Knew from the moment we met that there was no doubt
That my life would never be the same

And I could never hide this feeling
That comes over me
When you're near me, I know that's how
It's supposed to be
My heart is telling me

It's a love thing, yeah
Got me talking in my sleep
About the love we made
It's a love thing (it's a love thing)
Love thing (thing)

Such a feeling I get whenever we touch
Girl, like no other I felt before
It's still so new and yet I need you so much
Got to make you mine forever more

You're the kinda woman that can
Turn my world around
Cause you show me what unselfish
Love is all about
Without a doubt

It's a love thing, yeah
I feel that pounding in my heart
When you call my name
It's a love thing (it's a love thing)
Love thing (thing)

It's a love thing
Every time that you're near
It becomes so clear
It's a love thing (it's a love thing)
Love thing (thing) yeah

It's a love thing
I feel that pounding in my heart
When you call my name
It's a love thing (it's a love thing)
It's a love thing

And I could never hide the feeling
That comes over me
When you're near me, I know that's how
It's supposed to be
My heart is telling me

It's a love thing, yeah
Got me talking in my sleep
About the love we made
It's a love thing (it's a love thing)
Ooh, it's a love thing

It's a love thing (love thing)
Feel that beat in my heart
Looking right from the start
It's a love thing (it's a love thing)
Love thing (thing) love thing

It's a love thing
