Nightmare!


Dragged you down below, down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever 
(Peace of mind is less than never)

Hate to twist your mind, but God ain't on your side 
An old acquaintance severed
(Burn the world, your last endeavor)

Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal 
So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave until the end of time here
Nothing stops the madness turning
Haunting, yearning, pull the trigger

You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare


Can't wake up in sweat, cause it ain't over yet
Still dancing with your demons
(Victim of your own creation)

Beyond the will to fight, where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason
(Loathing self-assassination)

You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel 
So sedated as they medicate your brain and while you slowly go insane they tell ya
("Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications")

You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare

Fight 
Not to fail 
Not to fall 
Or you'll end up like the others

Die 
Die again 
Drenched in sin 
With no respect for another

Down 
Feel the fire 
Feel the hate 
Your pain is what we desire

Lost 
Hit the wall 
Watch you crawl 
Such a replaceable liar

And I know you hear their voices 
And I know they may seem real 
But our life's made up of choices 
They took for granted your soul and it's ours now to steal


You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare
