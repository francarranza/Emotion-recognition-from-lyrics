The sun is out
Spinning on its axis
Lead whit vapor in the clouds
The pavent sucks right through
The grates
The pavement sucks right
Throught the ground
Don't go to Harvard
Don't go to Yale
Your disposition
Will only make you fail
They got a brain trust
They got a bloodlust
The grey area fucks with your sight

Sun up, sun up
The sun is sinking
Sun up, sun up
The sun is down
Sun up, sun up
The sun is sinking
Sun up, sun up
The sun is out
