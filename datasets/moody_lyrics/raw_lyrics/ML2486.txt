Until you find the one you want to want you
Until you find her eyes constantly haunt you
Until no other lips can ever thrill you
You'll never know the glory of a heart in love

Until you're swept away with an emotion
As high as stars above, as great as the ocean
Don't say you've been in love for it isn't true
Until you love someone as I love you

(Until you find the one
As high as stars above)
Don't say you've been in love for it isn't true
Until you love someone as I love you

(I love you)
