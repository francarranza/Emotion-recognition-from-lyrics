Sleep, sleep
Live in peace
All is calm
So sleep

Silent night, holy night,
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child,
Holy infant so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night, holy night,
Shepherds quake at the sight,
Glories stream from heaven afar,
Heavenly hosts, they sing Alleluia;
Christ the Savior is born!
Christ the Savior is born!

Sleep, sleep
Live in peace
All is calm
So sleep

Sleep, sleep
Live in peace
All is calm
So sleep

All is calm
So sleep
All is calm
So sleep

All is calm
