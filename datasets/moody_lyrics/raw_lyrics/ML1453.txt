Baby, you and me been getting along for way too long
Life's been a bed of roses and sweet, sweet song
I know I should not complain, this is gonna sound insane, but

Let's fight, let's cuss, get mad, throw stuff
Maybe call each other names
Slam doors, break glass, I'll leave, come back
And I'll take all the blame

Let's scream, let's shout
Make up, make out
Baby, just for tonight
Let's fight

You might think that I might think you've lost your mind
A love like the one we've got is so hard to find
But I miss those crazy nights too
I tend to agree with you

Let's fight, let's cuss, get mad, throw stuff
Maybe call each other names
Slam doors, break glass, I'll leave, come back
And I'll take all the blame

Let's scream, let's shout
Make up, make out
Baby, just for tonight
Let's fight, baby let's fight

Don't wanna do what we always do
Five o'clock dinner, six o'clock news
Baby, roll up your sleeves, and put up your dukes

Let's fight
Baby, let's fight
(Baby, let's fight)

Let's fight, let's cuss, get mad, throw stuff
Maybe call each other names
Slam doors, break glass, I'll leave, come back
And I'll take all the blame

Let's scream, let's shout
Make up, make out
Baby, just for tonight
Let's fight

Baby, let's fight
(Scream and shout make up, make out)
Baby, let's fight
(Slam doors, break glass, I'll leave, come back)
Baby, let's fight
