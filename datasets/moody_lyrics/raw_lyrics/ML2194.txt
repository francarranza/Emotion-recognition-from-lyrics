Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
'Round your virgin, mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace 

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds, quake at the sight
Glory streams from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing allehujah
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born 

Recitation 

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy infant so infant and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
