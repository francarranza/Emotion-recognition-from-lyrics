It ain't the same old cold war Harry
It ain't the one you know
The sound of all that saber rattling
Makes the blood run cold

It ain't the same old cold war Harry
It ain't the one you know
It isn't black or white Mayberry
The whole place could blow

I got a little girl a cutting teeth
A pretty wife who's in the bed
Rather be makin' love or makin' peace
Don't wanna live a life of dread

It ain't the same old cold war Harry
Don't need a doomsday clock
To be alarmed by all the stars you're wearing
The funny way you talk

It ain't the same old cold war Harry
No puttin' up your dukes
That kinda talk is gettin' all too scary
You better nix your nukes

It ain't the same old cold war Harry
It ain't the one you know
But could ya not stand by that button
The whole place could blow

I got a little girl a cutting teeth
A pretty wife who's in the bed
Rather be makin' love or makin' peace
Don't wanna live a life of dread

It ain't the same old cold war Harry
It ain't the same old war
It ain't the same old cold war Harry
