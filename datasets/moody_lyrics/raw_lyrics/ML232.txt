But I party like a rock star.
I'm flyin' down 20 lookin' good in my hot car.
You know them ho be at my show,
Worried 'bout where my chain go.
I got a rubba in my pants,
But these ho won't let my thang go.

'Cause you know them ho be tryin' us
Ho don't you know I fuck wit' fine dimes,

When I'm in the spot bra...

Like a cop car.(whoop whoop)

On the yacht with Marylin Manson
Gettin' a tan man (yuuule)

You know me,
With a skull belt and wallet chain,
Shop Boyz, rock stars,
Yeah we 'bout to change the game. (change the game? uh ooh)
They know that I'm a star.
I make it rain from the center of my guitar

As soon I came out the womb,
My mama knew a star was born,
Now I'm on the golf course,
Trippin' wit' the Ozbournes.
I seen the show wit' Travis barker,
Rock star mentality,
I'm jumpin' in the crowd,
Just to see if they would carry meeeee.

White bitches wanna marry me,
They see me they just might panic.
My ice make 'em go down quick
Like the Titanic!
Yeah, I'm wit' the Shop Boyz,
You know what we do,
I'm surfin' screamin' "cowabunga"
