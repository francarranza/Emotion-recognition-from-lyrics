Why don't you ask me what it feels like to be a freak

Hey, do ya love me?
I'm untouchable darkness
A dirty black river
To get you through this
Hey, do ya love me?
I'm a devil machine
Get into my world
All American dream

In the mouth of madness
Down in the darkness
No more tomorrow
Down in the hollow

Hey, do ya love it when
The kids are screaming?
Wrecking on the road
Violate their dreaming
Hey, do ya love to see
The filth in the clean?
Get into the gone
All American dream

In the mouth of madness
Down in the darkness
No more tomorrow
Down in the hollow

I'm demon speeding
I'm demon speeding
I'm demon speeding
I'm demon speeding

Get it on, get it on
Get it on, get it on
Come alive

Hey, do ya love me?
Elevating the madness
A super death rising to
Get you through this
Hey, do ya love me
Like a beautiful fiend? Yeah
Get into my world
All American dream

In the mouth of madness
Down in the darkness
No more tomorrow
Down in the hollow

I'm demon speeding
I'm demon speeding
I'm demon speeding
I'm demon speeding
