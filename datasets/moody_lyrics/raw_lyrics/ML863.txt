Buzzing up with a musical attack
Rip it up with a boom sound we no lack
Got the rhythms the dub plate killa tracks
Annihilate and destroy them we do that
Letting them know that ah we come fe rock and control again
Oh, oh well
Setting the pace in the place - volume up, driving them insane
Oh das right

Turn your system down
You know the weak can't take it
Burn it to the ground
Watch how it shatters and they break it

(Pressure) stress it jusa drive them underground
(Pressure) cannot take the music killa sound
(Pressure) we will turn it up but never down
(Pressure) stress it just drive them underground
(Pressure) cannot take the music killa sound
(Pressure) we will turn it up but never down

Annoying neighbors are banging on your door
Saying that they can't take your noise no more
Your bass is right in their face sounds murder raw
But we ain't turning it off so call the law
Let them all know that the rockers is hard and is here to stay
Oh, oh well
Tell to move from your step and back off and just go away
Oh das right

Turn your system down
You know the weak can't take it
Burn it to the ground
Watch how it shatters and they break it

(Pressure) stress it jusa drive them underground
(Pressure) cannot take the music killa sound
(Pressure) we will turn it up but never down
(Pressure) stress it just drive them underground
(Pressure) cannot take the music killa sound
(Pressure) we will turn it up but never down
