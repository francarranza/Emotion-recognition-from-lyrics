Happy feelin's in the air touching people everywhere
Plenty love and everything listen to the people sing

I got myself to remind me of love
My mind and my heart I believe in above
These happy feelin's I'll spread them all over the world
From deep in my soul I wish you

Happy Feelin's Happy Feelin's
Happy Feelin's Happy Feelin's

I I've seen the light watch them shine down on me
I'm gonna spread my wings I'm gonna tell all I see
These happy feelin's I spread them all over the world
From deep in my soul

Happy Happy
Happy Happy feelin's
