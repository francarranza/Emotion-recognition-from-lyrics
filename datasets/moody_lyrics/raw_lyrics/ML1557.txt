Wake up, don't fear
I want to love you
Let go all pain
I let you get to me

Come back, don't be
Afraid of me, soon
That I'll harm you
Your eyes are blue, blue jewels

Come back, have faith
Someone like you
Can find the reason
Of what I did to you

Wake up, don't fear
I want to love you
Let go all pain
I let you get to me
