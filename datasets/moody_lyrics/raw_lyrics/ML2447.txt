Drum machine joy - Drum machine joy
Soon the Goodness King will heal your heart
From within the castle to his warm hearth
Granting Hope and Wisdom to your soul
The evil spell of sadness has been broken

In your heart, there's a world of sadness
I love you with all heart
In your heart with my words I promise
To love you with all heart,
And Drum Machine Joy

Soon the Goodness King will heal your heart
From the Northern Kingdom comes a faint sound
Growing stronger here before the hearth
The chorus of the King has come to heal your heart

In your heart, there's a world of sadness
I love you with all heart
In your heart with my words I promise
To love you with all heart,
And Drum Machine Joy
