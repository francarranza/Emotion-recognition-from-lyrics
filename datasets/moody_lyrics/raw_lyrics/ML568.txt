When the numbers get so high
Of the dead flying through the sky
O, I don't know why
Love comes to me
Love comes to me

When your mouth is laying ope
Head knocked back you don't cope
You're out of rings and flowers and soap
Love comes to me
Love comes to me

Love comes to me
Love comes and all
It's my hands, my heart, my lips
And that is all

When the fever hits your forehead
Intrusive mice chew up your bed
And you call on God and God is dead
Love comes to you
Love comes to you

O, sugar won't you be my only
I'm a hard-hearted honey-pot hungry shepherd
And I'm longing to be born for you, that's her

Love comes to you
Love comes and all
It's your hands, your heart, your lip
And that is all

In the night time when you feel me
And the backs of your knees conceal me
And your eyeballs unreal me
Love comes to me
Love comes to me
