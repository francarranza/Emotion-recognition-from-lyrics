Come and give me that Wildfire!
The uncivilized sound that I love
The primitive, like a blaze style!
Consciousness vibes I and I know
The untamed flame that I desire!
Me want uncultivated Jah glow
Foolish intensity, versatile!
He'll fly the spirit high, take me higher!

One leads with the passion
The righteous will burn again
One bleeds everlasting
Tribal fire will never end

One leads with the passion
The righteous will burn again
One bleeds everlasting
Tribal fire never ends

I want to feel that Wildfire!
Irregular burning of the sun
Shining through, make you spit fire!
Savage combustion, let it go
Impetuous, fervor testifier!
Outlandish passions I know
Crucial rhythms no Denial!
Musical nation, Empire!

One leads with the passion
The righteous will burn again
One bleeds everlasting
Tribal fire will never end

One leads with the passion
The righteous will burn again
One bleeds everlasting
Tribal fire never ends

One leads with the passion
Tribal fire will never end
The righteous will burn again
Tribal fire will never end
One bleeds everlasting
Tribal fire will never end
Tribal fire will never end

One leads with the passion
The righteous will burn again
One bleeds everlasting
Tribal fire never ends
