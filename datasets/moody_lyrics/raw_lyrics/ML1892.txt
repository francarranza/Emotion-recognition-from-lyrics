Till the morning comes
It'll do you fine
Till the morning comes
Like a highway sign
Showin' you the way
Leavin' no doubt
Of the way on in or the way back out

Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy

Till we all fall down
It'll do you fine
Don't think about
What you left behind
The way you came
Or the way you go
Let your tracks be lost in the dark and snow

Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy

When the shadows grow
It'll do you fine
When the cold winds blow
It'll ease your mind
The shape it takes
Could be yours to choose
What you may win, what you may lose

Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy

You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
