You tried to spit in the eye of a dead man's face
Attacked the ways of a man not yet in his grave
But your hate was over all too soon
Because nothing is over, and nothing's through
Till we bury you

For the love of brother
I will sing this fucking song
Aesthetics Of Hate
I hope you burn in hell

The words I read on the screen left me fucking sick
I felt the hatred rising
You son of a bitch
You branded us pathetic for our respect
But he made us Driven
Such deep reverence
Far beyond the rest

For the love of brother
I will sing this fucking song
Aesthetics of hate
I hope you burn in hell
Long live memories
Live his freedom vicariously
Defend tenfold
His honor we'll always uphold

For the love of brother
I will say these fucking words
No silence against ignorance
Iconoclast, I hope you burn in hell

May the hands of god strike them down
