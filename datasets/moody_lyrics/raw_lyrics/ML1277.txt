A woman in love
A woman in love
A woman in love
A woman in love


Have you ever seen a woman in love?
She walks taller than the highest mountain in the sky above
She glows like the beautiful rays of the sun
Have you ever seen a woman in love?

Have you seen a woman in love?
She knows how to make sunshine out of the rain
A woman in love
Knows exactly how to kiss away the pain

Singing Chorus:
A woman in love is more precious than gold
A woman in love is the truth untold

A woman in love seems to carry
The whole world in her arms

A woman in love
A woman in love
A woman in love
A woman in love


Have you ever seen a woman in love?
She carries a special purpose in this world
She glows like the beautiful rays of the sun
Have you ever seen a woman in love?
