I'm setting Fancy free, because she wants to go
She's tired of loving me, she told me so.
I guess she don't know just how much she means to me
But along with all my dreams I'm setting Fancy free.

Yes I'm setting Fancy free, even though I love her still
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will.
Even thou that girl, she's the best part of my world
Along with all my dreams I'm setting Fancy free.

Oh Lord you just don't know how it hurts to say goodbye
She did her best to stay, I can't say she did not try.
I just hope the road she takes leads back to me
So along with all my dreams I'm setting Fancy free.

Yes I'm setting Fancy free, even though I love her still
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will.
Even thou that girl, she's the best part of my world
Along with all my dreams I'm setting Fancy free.

Yes I'm setting Fancy free, even though I love her still
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will.
Even thou that girl, she's the best part of my world
Along with all my dreams I'm setting Fancy free.

Yes I'm setting Fancy free, even though I love her still
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will.
Even thou that girl, she's the best part of my world
