For fear, my eyes are closed 
I'll shut this out no more 
Embrace this and I become the catalyst 

And now it swells in me 
Smash all my defenses down 
I'll take this; I'll let this fire consume me 

I willl not, I will not
I will not fall; I will not fail 
I pound the walls; I shake the cage 
I will not fall; I will not fail 

Let the fire consume me 

This burning passion, it fills me with desire 
And drives me and it drives my cause 
I'm filled with reasons, but reasons drive me further 
Disdain for disbelief will stay the course 

Oh, let the fire consume me 
Let the fire burn 
Let the courage flow through me 
Let the fire burn

I pound the walls; I shake the cage 
I will not fall; I will not fail
I pound the walls; I shake the cage 
I will not fall; I will not fail 

Oh, let the fire consume me 
Let the fire burn 
Let the courage flow through me 
Let the fire burn

Let the fire consume me
