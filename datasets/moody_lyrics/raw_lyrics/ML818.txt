Wasn't the pulse just rockin' us
No sense and all pretend
There was a connection,
But was it ever thin
Birds in a row,
Information travelin' under them

Twist all the words in my mouth
Really twist 'em up don't be shy
I want to know how it feels to be the other guy
All gung-ho! And no lie

I may have a problem
I know why you backed out
My pride...

Would not let me be wrong ever
But somebody has to bend
Oh, Everlyn, won't you let me in
Hear, now, the words on my tongue
See, now, the tears and then
Oh, Everlyn, won't you let me back in
