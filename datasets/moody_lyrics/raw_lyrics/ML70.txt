Sun tanned toes ticklin' the sand
Cold drink chillin' in my right hand
Watchin' you sleep in the evening light
Restin' up for a long, long night.

'Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down, we'll be feelin' all right
When the sun sinks down, over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down.
Yeah!

All day long just takin' it easy
Layin' in the hammock where it's nice and breezy
Sleepin' off the night before
'Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be back for more.

When the sun goes down, we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down, we'll be feelin' all right
When the sun sinks down, over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down.

This old guitar and my dark sunglasses
The sweet concoction is smooth as molasses
Nothing to do but breathe all day
Until the big moon rises and it's time to play.

When the sun goes down, we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down, we'll be feelin' all right
When the sun sinks down, over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down.

When the sun goes down, we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down, we'll be feelin' all right
When the sun sinks down, over the water
She thinks Cracker's sexy when the sun goes down.

(Other versions may have the Chorus sang 1-2-3 more times)

We'll be feelin' all right
When the sun sinks down, over the water
Uncle Kenny's hotter when the sun goes down.

When the sun goes down, we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down.
Hey, Uncle Kenny.

When the sun goes down, over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down...
