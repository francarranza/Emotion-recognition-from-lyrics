Child of wonder, close Your eyes
Rest here in my arms tonight
Someday You will save the world
But tonight I'll hold You right here in my arms

Precious miracle of life, child of love
Gift of hope, the gift of light from the Father above
And You were made for all mankind
You will always be mine, child of love

Gabriel's promise has come true
God has blessed this world with You
And as I humbly hold You now
In my heart I know I'm holding Heaven's child

Precious miracle of life, child of love
Gift of hope, the gift of light from the Father above
And You were made for all mankind
But You will always be mine, child of love

Precious miracle of life, child of love
Gift of hope, the gift of light from the Father above
And You were made for all mankind
But You will always be mine, child of love

Child of wonder, close Your eyes
