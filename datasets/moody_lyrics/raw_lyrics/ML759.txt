Hot summer night
Storm clouds in the air 
My eyes' lids so heavy 
I'm feeling in the past tense
I'm hardly aware

I don't want you on the phone 
Don't you play good girl with me 
Why must I always say it again? 

I've got a new girl now 
I've got a new girl now 
I've got a new girl now 
And she's a lot like you 

I tried to wash my face 
But my head fell too low 
I tried to bear with myself 
But my mind wouldn't stay at home 

I don't care if you're sitting at home 
Somebody has broken into me 
Why must I always say it again? 

I got a new girl now 
I got a new girl now 
I got a new girl now 
And she's a lot like you 

I don't want you on the phone 
Don't you play good girl with me 
Why must I always say it again? 

I've got a new girl now 
I've got a new girl now 
I've got a new girl now 
And she's a lot like you

I've got a new girl now 
I've got a new girl now 
I've got a new girl now 
And she's a lot like you
Lot like you
Lot like you
Just like you
