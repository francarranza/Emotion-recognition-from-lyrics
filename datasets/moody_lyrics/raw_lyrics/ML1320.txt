Lookin' like basketballs

Patiently waitin' and takin' my time
Watchin' these haters
Don't come with they rhymes
Watchin these suckers are mimickin', gimmickin'
Then they start fallin' off one at a time
You can go search but you never could find,
I promise you derrty I'm one of a kind
Mold is broken, the formulas mine
I killed the idea and destroyed the design

I was patiently waitin' and takin' my time
Now that I'm here I'm gettin' my shine
All of you haters can kiss a behind,
Specifically speakin' I'm talkin' bout mine
Don't need you to tell me, I know that I'm fine
I'm killin' it baby so call it a crime
Yeah you watch it I'm stealin' my time
I told you before that big girls don't cry

Just walked through the door
What's it gonna be,
I can't get to the floor

Where my party people at? Where my party people at?
Where my party people at? Where my party people at?
Where my party people at? Where my party people at?
