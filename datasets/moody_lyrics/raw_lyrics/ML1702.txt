Treated you like a rusty blade
A throwaway from an open grave
Cut you loose from a chain gang and let you go

And on the day you said it's true
Some love holds, some gets used
Tried to tell you I never knew it could be so sweet

Who could ever be so cruel?
Blame the devil for the things you do
It's such a selfish way to lose
The way you lose these wasted blues
These wasted Blues

Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own

Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own

When the moon is a counterfeit
Better find the one that fits
Better find the one that lights the way for you

When the road is full of nails
Garbage pails and darkened jails
And their tongues are full of heartless tales that drain on you

Who would ever notice you?
You fade into a shaded room
It's such a selfish way to lose
The way you lose these wasted blues
These wasted blues

Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own

Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own

Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
