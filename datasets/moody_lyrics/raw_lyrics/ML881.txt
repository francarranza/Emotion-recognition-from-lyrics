Well, I've been judged
I've been a bug unknown
I know all about it 
But my heart is strong

I've been away 
Been running to save my head
Yeah, the warrant's out 
And I'm almost there
No one's said what I've already said

Got to get away
Yeah, the warrant's on my head
Got to get away
They want me alive or dead 

Got to get away
Yeah, the warrant's on my head
Got to get away
'Cause they want me alive or dead

I've thought a lot about the way that they fight
Come through the phone lines, not man enough to face me
I can stop or argue about what they say
Yeah, the warrant's out and I'm gonna pay
I said what I'm gonna say

Got to get away
Yeah, the warrant's on my head
Got to get away
They want me alive or dead 

Got to get away
Yeah, the warrant's on my head
Got to get away
'Cause they want me alive or dead 

Fear is like a fake friend
It warms you up and takes you in
You mouth the words but no sound comes out
And fear is like your best friend
Manipulates and takes you in
You mouth the words
No sound again

But you don't know better
Don't know better

Got to get away
Yeah, the warrant's on my head
Got to get away
They want me alive or dead 

Got to get away
Yeah, the warrant's on my head
Got to get away
'Cause they want me alive or dead 

Got to get away
Yeah, the warrant's on my head
Got to get away
They want me alive or dead 

Got to get away
Yeah, the warrant's on my head
Got to get away
'Cause they want me alive or dead
