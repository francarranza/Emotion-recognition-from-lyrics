Wonderful wonderful 

All you have to do is touch my hand 
To show me you understand 
And something happens to me 
That's some kind of wonderful 
At any time my little world seems blue 
I just have to look at you 
And everything seems to be 
Some kind of wonderful 

I know I can't express 
This feeling of tenderness 
There's so much I wanna say 
But the right words just don't come my way 
I just know when I'm in your embrace 
This world is a happy place 
And something happens to me 

There's some kind of wonderful 

I know I can't express 
This feeling of tenderness 
There's so much I wanna say 
But the right words just don't come my way 
I just know when I'm in your embrace 
This world is a happy place 
And something happens to me 
There's some kind of wonderful 

Some kind of sweet lips 
Some kind of warm eyes 
Some kind of soft sigh 
There's only some kind of wonderful 

Oh yeah wonderful
