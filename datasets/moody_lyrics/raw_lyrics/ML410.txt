Love is like a butterfly 
As soft and gentle as a sigh 
The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings 
Love makes your heart feel strange inside 
It flutters like soft wings in flight 
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing 

I feel it when you're with me 
It happens when you kiss me 
That rare and gentle feeling that I feel inside 
Your touch is soft and gentle 
Your kiss is warm and tender 
Whenever I am with you I think of butterflies 

Love is like a butterfly 
The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings 
Love makes your heart feel strange inside 
It flutters like soft wings in flight 
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing 

Your laughter brings me sunshine 
Everyday is spring time 
And I am only happy when you are by my side 
How precious is this love we share 
How very precious, sweet and rare 
Together we belong like daffodils and butterflies 

Love is like a butterfly 
As soft and gentle as a sigh 
The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings 
Love makes your heart feel strange inside 
It flutters like soft wings in flight 
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing 

Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing
