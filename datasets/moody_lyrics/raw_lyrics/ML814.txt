I never thought that this day would ever come
When your words and your touch just struck me numb
Oh, and it's plain to see that it's dead
The thing swims in blood and it's cold, stony dead

It's so hard not to feel ashamed
Of the loving, living games we play each day

And I'm stuck in a shack down the back of the sea
Oh, and I'm alive and I'm alone inside a sick, sick dream
Oh, is it me, is it me that feels so weak?
I cannot deceive but I find it hard to speak

The hardest walk you could ever take
Is the walk you take from A to B to C

I walk, oh honey, I talk

Don't want you to want me
Don't want you to need me
Don't want you to need me
Don't want you to need me

And I walk
