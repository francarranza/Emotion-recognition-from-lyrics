Now's not the time to be so sad and mournful
We are going to the funeral and we'll be dancing the night away
So, so, so don't be so shy, we are living and we're dying
We are laughing and we're crying every single day

Strange we're not surprising, [Incomprehensible]
How we tasted death like this to bring us together
You know you'll always be my flesh and blood
I could never do you wrong
And the one who was gone for so long is coming home

Alright now's not the time to be so sad and mournful
We are going to the funeral and we'll be dancing the night away
So, so, so don't be so shy, we are living and we're dying
We are laughing and we're crying every single day

We are getting older at the blink of an eye
So don't let the moment pass you by
I don't believe there is a greater love, one ? and pain
And the love between a momma and her children

And the procession down to the light house
We hear the crashing of the waves and the mistakes we made
You know that we are not the only ones so we can have some fun
Have some, have some, have some, have some fun

Now's not the time to be so sad and mournful
We are going to the funeral and we'll be dancing the night away
So, so, so don't be so shy, we are living and we're dying
We are laughing and we're crying every single day, every single day

It's not the time to be so, to be so sad
We are going to the funeral and we'll be dancing the night away
So, so, so don't be so shy, we are living and we're dying
We are laughing and we're crying every single day, every single day
