To understand the killer
I must become the killer
And I don't need this violence anymore
But now I've tasted hatred I want more

The velvet cell within men
Gloriously rusted masks
Grey death heart crocuses

And I had always thought
The desire to kill was a disease you caught
But it's dormant in the hearts of everyone
Waiting for a spark, an emotion
