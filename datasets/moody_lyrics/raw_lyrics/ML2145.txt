There is no way to write it ...there is no way to fight it
And I kick and scream but you got me despite it
And I got my pride so I begin to hide it
Like a fire in a free town you begin to lighten it...

Aha aha, aha aha
Sidii hogasha roobka (like the strength of the rain)
Ah aha, aha aha, you shine down upon me
Aha aha, aha aha,
Sidii hogasha roobka
Aha aha, aha aha, you shine down upon me

By some higher order you keep getting bolder...
By god or by country you kill like a soldier...
By some widdle you sung little but scream mighty stronger
Like fire in free town you old magic spoiler...

You place bins in my ribs and ask me to lie down
My pain is your pleasure but pleasure is all mine
You lend me your false ear and I lend you my false lines
Like fire in free town I'm fueled by your gold mine

She pulled out her match and she burned down my home
Fire Fire
She know it to touch me to turn me to stone
Fire Fire
She come like a storm and she rained on my lawn
Fire Fire
She pulled out her match and she burned down my home
Fire Fire
She come like a storm and she rained on my lawn
Fire Fire
She know it to touch me she know it I know
Fire Fire
She come like a storm and she rained on my lawn
Fire Fire
She pulled out her match and she burned down my home
