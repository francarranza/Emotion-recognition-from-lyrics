Sign a petition under working condition
Union is in bed with the coal operators
Carry our freedom looking for something
To get your family better life for every single day

Some things keep me going
Well I got no one to blame
Five o'clock is coming
Do you feel the same
When a lonely whistle
Calls out your name

All the men look the same
When they come out the mine
No prejudice for the mighty black lung
Rank and file workers, rank and file minds
Take off the gloves and sock it to 'em

Some things keep me going
Well I got no one to blame
Five o'clock is comin'
Do you feel the same
When a lonely whistle
Calls out your name

Hey unbeliever
Black lung fever
Transmit receiver
Stand up deceiver
Well I don't like it either
We're all presidents for the
Black lung fever

Some things keep me going
Well I got no one to blame
Five o'clock is coming
Do you feel the same
When a lonely whistle
Calls out your name
