Hello, I'm your martyr, will you be my gangster? 
Can you feel my trigger hand, moving further down your back?
When you hide, hide inside that body 
But just remember that when I touch you 
The more you shake, the more you give away 

Cold, but I'm still here, blind, 'cause I'm so blind, say never 
We're far from comfortable this time 
Cold, now we're so cold, mine, and you're not mine, say never 
We're far from obvious this time 

Wait another minute here, time will kill us after all 
Can you feel its second hand wrapped around your neck 
So fall into my eyes and fall into my lies 
But don't you forget 
The more you turn away, the more I want you to stay 

Cold, but I'm still here, blind, 'cause I'm so blind, say never 
We're far from comfortable this time 
Cold, now we're so cold, mine, and you're not mine, say never 
We're far from obvious this time 

You're so endearing, you're so beautiful, 
Well I don't look like they do, and I don't love like they do 
But I don't hate like they do 
Am I ever on your mind? 

Cold, but I'm still here, blind, 'cause I'm so blind, say never 
We're far from comfortable this time 
Cold, now we're so cold, mine, and you're not mine, say never 
We're far from obvious this time  

(Cold) You broke me from the very first night 
I'm far too comfortable this time 
(Cold) I loved you from the very first night 
You broke me 'til the day that I die 
I'm far too obvious this time
