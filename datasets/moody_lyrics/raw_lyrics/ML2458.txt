I hear these times are the end
And another one must fall down
I don't think I believe it
When another one must fall down
Give us the distance
And another one will fall down

The sun in the open sky
Fall down, fall down
Stare back into my own eyes
Fall down, fall down
A stranger in my own skin
Fall down, fall down

One decade later
And another one must fall down
The earth isn't humming
I watched them all fall down

Fell into the sound in front of me
Unchanged by those around
Directionless, an open sea
We'll watch as time tumbles down

The sun in the open sky
Fall down, fall down
Stare back into my own eyes
Fall down, fall down
A stranger in my own skin
Fall down, fall down

Fall down
