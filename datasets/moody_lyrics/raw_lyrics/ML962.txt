Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I am so lonely 

Yo, this one here goes out to all my players out there, man
Ya know, that got that one good girl, Lord
That's always been there
Like took all the bullshit
Then one day she can't take it no more and decide to leave

Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreamin' for her
I was feenin' so I had to take a little ride

Backtracking over these few years
Tryin' ta figure out what I do to make it go bad
'Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashing and I'm so...

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)
I am so lonely

Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right outta my life
After all I put you through 
You still stuck around and stayed by my side

What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby you're a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
'Cause without you in my life girl I'm so...

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)
I am so lonely

Been all about the world, ain't never met a girl 
That can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come where you'd get up and run 
And I would be out chasing you

'Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see 
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely...

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)
I am so lonely

Never thought that I'd be alone (be alone)
I didn't think you'd be gone this long (gone so long)
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playing girl and come on home (come on home)

Baby girl I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out (work it out baby)
I had never wished to ever hurt my baby (hurt my baby)
And it's drivin' me crazy 'cause I'm so...

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
