We were conduits of love
Live like phosphoresence
Half asleep and self-indulged
We've lost our essence
Can't you see
We fell rain black from the stars above
When will we
Take an axe to the frozen seasons
We were epitomies of flesh and blood
We were luminescent
Half-aware and self-involved
We've lost our essence
Can't you see
We fell rain black from the stars above
When will we
Take an axe to the frozen seasons
