If you don't love me, baby
Let me know
'Cause you're breaking my heart
And it hurts me so

Playin' these games
And messin' with my mind
Girl, you made me believe
You were only mine

I don't wanna lose your love, oh
I guess I have to let you go
I don't wanna watch you leave, oh
I guess I have to walk away

Girl, you said you loved me
And you'd never go
You were lyin' to me
You thought I'd never know

I just wanna tell you
Girl, before I go
Take a good look at me
I won't be back no more

I don't wanna lose your love, oh
I guess I have to let you go
I don't wanna watch you leave, oh
I guess I have to walk away

No quero perder tu amor, oh
Pero te voya dejar irr
No quero mirarte irr, oh
Voya tener que andar de aqui

Girl, you said you loved me
And you'd never go
You were lyin' to me
You thought I'd never know

I just wanna tell you
Girl, before I go
Take a good look at me
I won't be back no more

No quero perder tu amor, oh
Pero te voya dejar irr
No quero mirarte irr, oh
Voya tener que andar de aqui

I don't wanna lose your love, oh
I guess I have to let you go
I don't wanna watch you leave, oh
I guess I have to walk away
