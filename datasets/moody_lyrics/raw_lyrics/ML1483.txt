If I could give you the world
On a silver platter
Would it even matter
You'd still be mad at me

If I could find in all this
A dozen roses
Which I would give to you
You'd still be miserable

In reality
I'm gone be who I be
And I don't feel no fault
For all the lies that you bought
You can try as you may
Break me down but I say
That it ain't up to you
Gone and do what you do

Hate on me hater
Now or later
'Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad baby (go head and hate)
Go head and hate on me hater
I'm not afraid of
What I gotta to pay for
You can hate on me

Ooh if I gave you peaches
Out my own garden
And I made you a peach pie
Would you slap me out

Wonder if I gave you diamonds
Out of my own womb
Would you feel the love in that
Or ask why not the moon

If I gave you sanity
For the whole of humanity
Have all the solutions
For the pain and pollution

No matter where I live
Despite the things I give
You'll always be this way
So go head and hate

Hate on me hater
Either now or later
'Cause I'm gonna do me (I'm gonna do me)
You'll be mad baby (go head and hate)
Go head and hate on me hater
I'm not afraid of
What I got I paid for
You can hate on me

Hate on me hater
Either now or later
'Cause I'm gonna do me (I'm gonna do me)
You'll be mad baby (go head and hate)
Go head and hate on me hater
I'm not afraid of
What I got I paid for
You can hate on me

You cannot hate on me
'Cause my mind is free
Fill my destiny
So shall it be

You cannot hate on me
'Cause my mind is free
Fill my destiny
So shall it be

You cannot hate on me

'Cause my mind is free

Fill my destiny

So shall it be

You cannot hate on me

'Cause my mind is free

Fill my destiny

So shall it be

You cannot hate
