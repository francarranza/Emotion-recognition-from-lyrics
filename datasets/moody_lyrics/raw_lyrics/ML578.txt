Broken down one by one
They'll take your pride and crush it
The fall that comes is real, by pure degradation
Amputate, Humiliate
Who can take this punishment?
Create something new
A warrior where there once was nothing

Destroy the body and mind
Behold the spirit can survive
Destroy the body and mind
Today is a good day to die

(Broken mind) - Face down in the sand
(Spirit) Spirit - (Rise) Rise

Destruction comes only once in a lifetime
Cannot be great in your mind
This is the time to say your last prayer
If you desire peace, then prepare for war

Destroy the body and mind
Behold the spirit can survive
Destroy the body and mind
Today is a good day to die
Destroy the body and mind
Behold the spirit can survive
Destroy the body and mind
I am ready for mine

(Broken mind) - Face down in the sand
(Spirit) Spirit - (Rise) Rise

(Broken mind) - Face down in the sand
(Spirit) Spirit - (Rise) Rise
Prepare for war - Rise
Prepare for war - And rise
