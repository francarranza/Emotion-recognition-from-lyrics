Flashbacks of the times we've had
Some made us laugh some made us sad
We used to break up to make up
All the fun that came from those love games
Oh well, I think I need someone new
Oh, it just won't do, because I think about you baby

From beginging to end 365 days of the year
I want your same ol' love
All I want to you is keep on loving you
I want your same ol' love

There's a reason I feel this way
All the things you do, well it might be the things that you say
Your love never changes
It's like a picture in a frame, and it remains the same

Your undying love for me
Oh it keeps me strong, keeps me holding on

From beginging to end 365 days of the year
I want your same ol' love
All I want to do is share my life with you
I want your same ol' love

Slowly, love me
All is forsaken, I love the love we're making
'Cause it's truly lovely
I'll never leave you, you'll know I need you baby

From beginging to end 365 days of the year
I want your same ol' love
All I want to do is share my life with you
I want your same ol' love
