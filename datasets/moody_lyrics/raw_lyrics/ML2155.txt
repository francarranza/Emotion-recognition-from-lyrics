You were my devotion
But now you're my emotion
Can't you see, can't you see
Oh, what you done to me?

You were my inspiration
But now you're my deviation
Can't you see, can't you see
Oh, what you done to me?

Can't you see, can't you see
Oh, what you done to me?
Open up your eyes
And realize it's me

You were my one and only
And now you're gone out, so lonely
Can't you see, can't you see
Oh, what you done to me?

Yeah, can't you see
Oh, what you're doing to me?
Open up your eyes
And realize it's me

You were my one and only
And now you're gone out, so lonely
Can't you see, can't you see
What you done to me?

Can't you see, can't you see
Oh, what you done to me?
Can't you see, can't you see
Oh, what you done to me?
