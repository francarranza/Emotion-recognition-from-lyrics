(I wanna take the time to tell you, oh my)

Life is lovely, oh so lovely
Live is lovely when you love
It's exciting, and inviting
Life is lovely when you love
Love is patient, Love is kind, and
Love is the key to life's peace of mind
Oh, It's exciting when you love
When you love

Be inspired, so inspired
Be inspired when you love
Be inspired, hold on tighter
Be inspired when you love
Write them a poem, or sing them a song
Draw them painting, walk arm-in-arm
Be inspired when you love
When you love

Be romantic, so romantic
Be romantic when you love
Be romantic, so romantic
Be romantic when you love
Draw in the sand, or write in the sky
Tell them you'll love them till the day that you die

So, be romantic when you love
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Be committed, so committed
Be committed when you love
Be committed and stick with it
Be committed when you love
Go get a preacher, go get a singer
Go put a diamond ring on her finger
Be committed when you love
Love, Love, Love

Let them find out, let them find out
Let them find out when you love
Let them find out, take the time out
And let them find out when you love
'Cause if you love them, why don't you tell them?
Give them flowers while they can smell them
And let them find out, let them find out
Take the time out, take the time out
Let them find out, let them find out

When you love, love, love?
When you love, love, love
