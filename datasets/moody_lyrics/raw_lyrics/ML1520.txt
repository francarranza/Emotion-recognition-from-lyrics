Every day she takes a morning bath, she wets her hair
Wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair
It's just another day
Slipping into stockings
Stepping into shoes
Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
It's just another day

At the office where the papers grow she takes a break
Drinks another coffee and she finds it hard to stay awake
It's just another day
It's just another day
It's just another day

So sad, so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad
Alone in apartment she'd dwell
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell
Ah, stay, don't stand her up
And he comes and he stays
But he leaves the next day, so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad

As she posts another letter to the sound of five
People gather 'round her and she finds it hard to stay alive
It's just another day
It's just another day
It's just another day

So sad, so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad
Alone in apartment she'd dwell
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell
Ah, stay, don't stand her up
And he comes and he stays
But he leaves the next day, so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad

Every day she takes a morning bath, she wets her hair
Wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair
It's just another day
Slipping into stockings
Stepping into shoes
Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
Oh-oh-oh, it's just another day
It's just another day
It's just another day
