Love love love you baby
Love love love you baby love you

Well I can't give you anything but love baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of baby
You dream awhile and you scheme awhile
You're sure to find happiness and
I guess all the things you think are fine

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell baby
Diamond bracelets Woolworth won't sell to you baby
Till the lucky day you know darn well baby
I can't give you anything but love

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell baby
Diamond bracelets Woolworth ain't gonna sell to you baby
Till the lucky day you know darn well baby
Well I can't give you anything but love
