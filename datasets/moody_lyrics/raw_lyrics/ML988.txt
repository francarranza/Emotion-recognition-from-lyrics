Come on

Come along
Come on and get up, get down

(Get up) and get down
Get up out of your seat
(Get up) and get down
Get up and move your feet

(Come on and) rise, rise, rise
Shake your hips
(Get up) let me see you

(I wanna see you)
Let me see your tight wire come alive

(Get up) you ain't too old
(You ain't too hip) (get up)
I ain't asking for a cartwheel
(A somersault) or no flip

I just want you to

(Get up) and get down
Get up out of your seat
(Get up) and get down
Get up and move your feet

(Get up) now look at mama
(Look at mama)
She'll tear you up (get up)
To make sure you feel the cool
I get to turn the music up

(Get up) clap your hands
Stomp your feet (get up)
Keep in time with the music
Get on down with the beat

I just want you to

(Get up) and get down
Get up out of your seat
(Get up) and get down
Get up and move your feet

Come on

(Get up) and get down
Get up out of your seat
(Get up) and get down
Get up and move your feet

Come on and get down
Get up and get down
Come on, girl, oh, ooh

(Get up) and get down
Get up out of your seat
(Get up) and get down
Get up and move your feet

(Get up) and get down
Get up out of your seat
(Get up) and get down
Get up and move your feet
