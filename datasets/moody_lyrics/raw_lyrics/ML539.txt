Sometimes a girl
Will come and go
You reach for love
But life won't let ya know
That in the end
You'll still be lovin' her
But then she's gone
You're all alone

Sign of pain
Is on my face, well
My hearbeat stops
But I won't take the blame, no no
I gave her all the love I had within
My love was strong
Somethin' went wrong, no! no!

It takes a fool to learn
Yes sir
That love don't love nobody
Love love love love love love
It takes a fool to learn
Yes it does, girl
That love don't love no one
That love don't love no one
It takes a fool to learn
Stop to think about it, well
That love don't love nobody
Oh! Oh no!
It takes a fool to learn
When you're down and out, shout about it
That love don't love no more
Tell the world, ooh babe
No more
Oh, babe
It takes a fool to learn
Gotta be more careful about myself
That love don't love nobody
It takes a fool to learn
Whoa baby, took me a long time to learn, to learn, well

That love don't love no one
It takes a fool to learn
I was a fool, you were a fool
That love don't love nobody
Now we got love, we need love
It takes a fool to learn
