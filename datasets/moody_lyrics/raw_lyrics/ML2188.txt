I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red
On a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing dear, if you're not here with me

And the wind knows blue snowflakes start falling
When those blue, blue memories start calling
You'll be doing alright
With your Christmas of white
Oh, but I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

You'll be doing alright
With your Christmas of white
Oh, but I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

And when you need and pray on this Christmas day
Remember I have a blue, blue Christmas
Remember I have a blue, blue Christmas
And remember I have a blue, blue Christmas
