Well, how come you say you will when you won't?
Say you do, baby, when you don't?
Let me know, honey, how you feel
Tell the truth now, is love real?

But uh-uh
Well, honey, don't
Well, honey, don't
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
I say you will when you won't
Uh-uh, honey, don't

Well I love you, baby, and you ought to know
I like the way that you wear your clothes
Everything about you is so doggone sweet
You got that sand all over your feet

But ah-ah
Well, honey, don't
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
I say you will when you won't
Ah-ah, honey, don't

I feel fine
I'm sad

Well, sometimes I love you on a Saturday night
Sunday morning you don't look right
You've been out painting the town
Ah-ah, baby, been stepping around

But ah-ah
Well, honey, don't
I said
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
I say you will when you won't
Ah-ah, honey, don't

Well, honey, don't
Well, honey, don't
A little little honey, don't
I say you will when you won't
Ah-ah, honey, don't
