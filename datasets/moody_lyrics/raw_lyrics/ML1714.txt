We're breaking up, getting lost in the static
You're getting blurry right in front of me
The footsteps growing quiet in the hallway as I let go

The gravity that attracts us
Helps us implode
Or else we keep divinding
But I know, I know

We're aimed straight at each other
We are doomed to crash
So strike up a fire, light up the town
Because we're aimed straight at each other
This was meant to last
So don't try to fight it, the chaos will calm us down

Our lips move but we speak in a language
That neither one of us can understand.
You sleepwalk through the tape and the sirens
And I let it go, let it go

The rules of our attraction
Were carved in stone
And yet, you keep resisting
But I know, I know

We're aimed straight at each other
We are doomed to crash
So strike up a fire, light up the town
Because we're aimed straight at each other
This was meant to last
So don't try to fight it, the chaos will calm us down

It doesn't matter
It's a disaster
The chaos will calm us down

We're aimed straight at each other
We are doomed to crash
So strike up a fire, light up the town
'Cause we're aimed straight at each other
This was meant to last
So don't try to fight it, the chaos will calm us down

We're aimed straight at each other
We are doomed to crash
So strike up a fire, light up the town
'Cause we're aimed straight at each other
This was meant to last
So don't try to fight it, the chaos will calm us down
