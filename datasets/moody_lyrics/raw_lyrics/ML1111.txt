Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Your perfect love is casting out fear
And even when I'm caught in the middle of the storms of this life
I won't turn back
I know You are near

And I will fear no evil
For my God is with me
And if my God is with me
Whom then shall I fear
Whom then shall I fear

Oh no You never let go
Through the calm and through the storm
Oh no You never let go
In every high and every low.
Oh no You never let go
Lord You never let go of me, yeah

And I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on
A glorious light beyond all compare
And there will be an end to these troubles
But until that day comes
We'll live to know You here on the earth

And I will fear no evil
For my God is with me
And if my God is with me
Whom then shall I fear
Whom then shall I fear

Oh no You never let go
Through the calm and through the storm
Oh no You never let go
In every high and every low.
Oh no You never let go
Lord You never let go of me, yeah

Yes, I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on
And there will be an end to these troubles
But until that day comes, oh
Still I will praise You, Lord still I will praise You, Lord, oh

Singing
Oh no You never let go
Through the calm and through the storms
Oh no You never let go
Every high and every low.
Oh no You never let go, Lord
You never let go of me, yeah

Singing
Oh no You never let go
Through the calm and through the storm
Oh no You never let go
In every high and every low.
Oh no You never let go, Lord
You never let go of me, yeah

Oh, You never let of me, oh, oh
You never let go of me, Lord
