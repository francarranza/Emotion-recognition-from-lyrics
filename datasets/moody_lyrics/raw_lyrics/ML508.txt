Hello my friend
I remember when you were
So alive with your wide eyes to the light
Then the light that you had when your heart was stolen
Now you say that it ain't worth stayin'
You wanna run but your hesitatin'
I'm talkin' to me

Don't let the lights go down
Don't let the fire burn out
Cause somewhere, somebody needs a reason to believe
Why don't you rise up now?
Don't be afraid to stand out
That's how the lost get found
The lost get found

So when you get the chance (get the chance)
Are you gonna take it (take it)
There's a really big world at your fingertips
And you know you have the chance to change it
There's a girl on the streets, she's cryin'
There's a man who faith is dying
Love is calling you

Don't let the lights go down
Don't let the fire burn out
Cause somewhere, somebody needs a reason to believe
Why don't you rise up now?
Don't be afraid to stand out
That's how the lost get found
The lost get found

Why do we go with the flow?
Why take the easier road?
Why are we playin' it safe?
Love came to show us the way
Love is a chance we should take
I'm movin' out of the way

Don't let the lights go down

Are you gonna take it
