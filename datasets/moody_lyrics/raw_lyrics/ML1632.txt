If this will be
Anything
Then let it be
Over.

Because the heart can't keep
Trying
To love something
It doesn't.

If this will be
Anything
Then let it be a
Disaster.

A mouthful of bees
Couldn't stop me
From whispering,
I don't know you.

But if scars could sing
About the permanent things
They'd say it's damaged
But it was something.

If this will be anything
Then let it be over.
