She sings from somewhere you can't see
She sits in the top of the greenest tree 
Sends out an aroma of undefined lust
It drips on down in a mist from above 

She's just the girl, she's just the girl 
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want

You hear her callin' everywhere you turn 
You know you're headed for the pleasure burn 
But the words get stuck on the tip of your tongue 
She's the real thing but you knew it all along 

She's just the girl, she's just the girl 
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl 
The girl you want

Look at you with your mouth, it's waterin'
Look at you with your mind spinnin'
Why don't we just admit it's all over 
She's just the girl you want 

She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, just the girl 
The girl you want

She sings from somewhere you can't see 
She sits in the top of the greenest tree 
Sends out an aroma of undefined lust 
It drips on down in a mist from above 

She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want

Look at you with your mouth, it's waterin'
Look at you with your mind spinnin'
Why don't we just admit it's all over 
She's just the girl you want 

She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, just the girl 
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
