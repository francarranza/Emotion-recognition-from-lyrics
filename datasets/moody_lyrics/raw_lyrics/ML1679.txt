O little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see the lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by; (go by)
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.

O
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary,
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth,
And praises sing to God our King,
And peace to men on earth!

O
And praises sing to God our King
And peace to men on earth!

Let there be peace on Earth
And let it begin with me

Let there be peace on Earth
And let it begin right now

Please, Jesus, You know we need You
Peace on Earth
Come and hear us
Angel voices
Peace on Earth
Here and now

All our hopes and fears in all the years
Are met in Thee tonight

So let there be peace tonight
