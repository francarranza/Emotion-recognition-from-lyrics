Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...
Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...
Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...
Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...

If I could I'd give you the world
Wrap it all around you
Won't be satisfied with just a piece of his heart

My angel
Oh, angel
You're my angel
Oh, angel

Dreams are dreams, some dreams come true
I found a real dream, baby, when I found you
You're so strong, but tender too

You're my angel
Oh, angel
You're my angel
Oh, angel

Love like ours is heaven sent
Each day a day to remember
Feel so safe, feel secure with you...

You... give me love, you keep right on givin'
Fill me up, baby, with the joy of living
When things get tough I can always turn to you

You're my angel
Oh, angel
You're my angel

Love the way we touch, I love the way it feels
Every time you're near me my poor heart just won't keep still
No doubt about it that this love I feel is real
Ask me to go with you, you know I will

Hold me near, hold me tight
Only you can make it real, only you make it all right
Just let me know that I am special to you

My angel
Oh, angel
You're my angel
Oh, angel

You're my angel
Oh, angel
You're my angel
Oh, angel

Fades:You're my angel
Oh, angel
