Well there's gold in the mountains
And a people living in the sea
Oh yeah

You know that I love you oh
And don't you know that you love me

We make feasties of the beasties
But the beasties all live in the wild
Oh yeah

You know that you're slower now
But you were faster when you were a child

Well there's gold in the mountains
And a people living in the sea
Oh yeah

You know that I love you
Oh don't you know that you love me
Yeah you do, you always do, yeah you do
