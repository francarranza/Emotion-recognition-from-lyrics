I was waiting for you to notice me
I been hanging around for a minute
Baby don't give me you it won't hurt me
I don't even know if you deserve me

But with that moon in the sky
Who wants to be alone
And when the stars shine so bright
Who wants to be alone

Don't take me home till the sun comes up till the sun comes up x4

Right next to me
You wanna be
Till the sun comes up

I am goin' nowhere in a hurry
Baby come take away all my worries

But with that moon in the sky
Who wants to be alone
And when the stars shine so bright
Who wants to be alone

Don't take me home till the sun comes up till the sun comes up x4

Right next to me
You wanna be
Till the sun comes up

I'm out of my head x5

But with that moon in the sky
Who wants to be alone
And when the stars shine so bright
Who wants to be alone

Don't take me home till the sun comes up till the sun comes up x4

Right next to me
You wanna be
Till the sun comes up
