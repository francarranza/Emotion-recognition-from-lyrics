We've got troubles
Something's just not right
Just this morning you cried about last night
You said that something's bound to break this time

What's breaking is my heart
I can read between the lines
It's tearing me apart
You've got leaving on your mind

But you're my angel baby
Yes, you're my angel baby
Whoa, you're my angel baby
For the rest of the night

Do you remember how it used to be?
Loving was easier when you were loving me
I guess you found someone and now I find

What's breaking is my heart
You've got leaving on your mind

But you're my angel baby
Yes, you're my angel baby
Whoa, you're my angel baby
For the rest of the night

What's breaking is my heart
I can read between the lines
It's tearing me apart
You've got leaving on your mind

But you're my angel baby
For the rest of the night
(Angel baby) The rest of the night
(Angel baby)
(Angel baby) For the rest of the night
(Angel baby) For the rest of the night
(Angel baby) For the rest of the night
