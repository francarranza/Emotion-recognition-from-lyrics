You take away
I feel the same

You take away
I feel the same
All the promises you made to me
You made in vain
I lost myself inside
Your tainted smile again

Cause you can't feel my anger
You can't feel my pain
You can't feel my torment
Driving me insane
I can't fight these feelings
They will bring you pain
You can't take away
Make me whole again

I feel betrayed
Stuck in your ways
And you rip me apart with the
Brutal things you say
I can't deal with this shit anymore
I just look away

Cause you can't feel my anger
You can't feel my pain
You can't feel my torment
Driving me insane
I can't fight these feelings
They bring only pain
You can't take away
Make me whole again

You take away
I feel the same
All these promises
You promised only pain
If you take away
And leave me with nothing again

Cause you can't feel my anger
You can't feel my pain
You can't feel my torment
Driving me insane
I can't fight these feelings
They bring me pain
You can't take away
Make me whole again

You will feel my anger
You will feel my pain
You will feel my torment
Driving you insane
I can't fight these feelings
They will bring you pain
You won't take away
I'll be whole again
