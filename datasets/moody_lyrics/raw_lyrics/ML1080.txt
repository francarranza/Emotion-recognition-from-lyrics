- People see rock and roll as, as youth culture, and when youth culture becomes monopolised by big business, what are the youth to do? Do you, do you have any idea? I think we should destroy the bogus capitalist process that is destroying youth culture. (Thurston Moore)

When I look at you, heaven's on fire
I wish I didn't know you better, but it's pointless
One look at you and heaven's on fire
When I look at you, I reach for a piano wire
Fighting to keep it together, but it's pointless
One look at you and heaven's on fire, heaven's on fire

It seems like everyone is on your side
We're outnumbered by those who take no pride
In constantly moving against the tide
Charlatans just out of reach and out of time

I'm a little like you, ugly on the inside
But while I dive into the gritty you just stand by
When I look at you, heaven's on fire, heaven's on fire

It seems like everyone is on your side
We're outnumbered by those who take no pride
In constantly moving against the tide
Charlatans just out of reach and out of time
