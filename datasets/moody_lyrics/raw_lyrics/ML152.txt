I don't mind if you're keeping someone else behind
I don't care 'cause you've got something I can share

Hey, take a chance, even if it's only
Only while we're dancing in the 
Light of your second sight because
When you understand me 
You might feel good around me now.

I don't want your love to bring me down
I don't want your love so turn it around

I won't turn you out if you've got someone else
Someone else you care about
Because you must realise
My obsessive fascination is in your imagination
(Now back it up)

I don't want your love to bring me down
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
I don't want your love so turn it around

Your rhythm is the power to move me
It's something you control completely
I don't want your love
I don't want your love
(I don't want your love)

I like noise 'cause I like waking up the house
I cannot sit down. I can't shut my mouth
But when you understand me,
You might feel good around me
(Now back it up)

I don't want your love to bring me down
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
I don't want your love so turn it around
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)

Your rhythm is the power to move me
It's something you control completely
I don't want your love
I don't want your love
(I don't want your love)

(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
I don't want your love to bring me down
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
I don't want your love so turn it around
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)

I don't want your love
(Rhythm)
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
(Rhythm)
I don't want your love
(Rhythm)
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
(The rhythm is the power)

I don't want your love
(Rhythm)
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
(Rhythm)
I don't want your love
(Rhythm)
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
(The rhythm is the power)

I don't want your love
(Rhythm)
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
To bring me down
(Rhythm)
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
(The rhythm is the power)

I don't want your love
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
