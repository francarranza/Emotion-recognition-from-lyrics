Well I can see my reflection reflecting in you
And I can feel the connection connecting the two
It's dream reality,
Trying to break free and wake me
Dream reality
Trying to break free from this world,
From the world

Well I can feel your reactions reacting with mine
And I can sense things are happening
And they're happening on time
It's dream reality, t
Rying to break free and wake me
Dream reality
Trying to break free from this world,
From the world

Dream reality
Trying to break free and wake me
Dream reality
Trying to break free from this world,
Free from the world
Let me free from this world,
Free from the world

Well I can feel your directions
Directing me on line
And I believe you're responding,
Responding to your mind
It's dream reality,
Trying to break free and wake me
Dream reality

Trying to break free from this world
Free from this world
Free from this world
From the world
