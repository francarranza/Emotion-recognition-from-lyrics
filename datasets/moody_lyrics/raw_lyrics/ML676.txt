Heaven is the home of our hearts
And heaven won't tear you apart
Yeah heaven is the home of our hearts
And heaven don't tear you apart

There's too many kings wanna hold you down
And a world is a window gone underground
There's a hole in the sky where the sun don't shine
And a clock on the wall and it counts my time

Heaven is the home of our hearts
And heaven don't tear you apart

There's a song on the air with a love-you line
And a face in a glass and it looks like mine
And I'm standing on ice when I say that I don't hear planes
And I scream at the fools, wanna jump my train

Heaven is the home of our hearts
And heaven won't tear you apart
Yeah heaven is the home of our hearts
And heaven don't tear you apart
Yeah heaven
Ah heaven
Yeah heaven
