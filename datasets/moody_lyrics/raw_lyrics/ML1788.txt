I wanna go where the warm winds blow me
I just wanna ease my mind
I wanna run through the sand and the sun
Leavin' it all behind

Watch that ol' moon risin' on the horizon
Turnin' from gold to blue
It's just makin' it easy for takin' it easy with you

Somewhere far away those night birds call my name
I can hear them singing love songs just for me and you
For a million summer nights this dream has been the same
It's just you and me and the stars and the sand and the sea

I wanna go where the warm winds blow me
I just wanna ease my mind
I wanna run through the sand and the sun
Leavin' it all behind

Watch that ol' moon risin' on the horizon
Turnin' from gold to blue
Ooh it's just makin' it easy for takin' it easy with you

Every time I look into your emerald eyes
I just want to take you far away
'Cause I know you deserve to live in paradise
And babe you know I'll get you there someday

'Cause I wanna go where the warm winds blow me
I just wanna ease my mind
I wanna run through the sand and the sun
Leavin' it all behind

Watch that ol' moon risin' on the horizon
Turnin' from gold to blue
It's just makin' it easy for takin' it easy with you

I wanna go where the warm winds blow me
I just wanna ease my mind
I wanna run through the sand and the sun
Leavin' it all behind
