Well you know I don't get off on workin' day after day
I wanna have some fun while I'm here
I play the game when it's goin' my way
And there's nothin' like a party when it's kickin' into gear 

I'm gettin' ready for a party tonight
Yes I'm gettin' ready to cruise 
And if you've got somethin' for me
I've got somethin' for you 

Baby
It's a party and nobody cares
What we're doin' there 
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there
It's a party, party, party! 

I can't believe it when some people say
That it's a sin that way we live to die
You know, there's never been a more natural thing
Yea there's a brand new story, but it's the same old lie 

So come on
Get ready for the time of your life
'Cause I'm gettin' right in the groove
And if you've got somethin' for me
I've got somethin' for you 

Baby
It's a party and nobody cares
What we're doin' there 
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there
It's a party, party, party! 

Yea yea yea yea get down and party if you need a cue
You're sure to find one in the crowd
Just meet some friends and have a toke or two
In a place where they can never play the music too loud 

Get ready for a party tonight
'Cause I'm gettin' right in the groove 
And if you've got somethin' for me 
I've got somethin' for you 

Baby
It's a party and nobody cares
What we're doin' there 
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there
It's a party, party, party! 

You know a man doesn't live on bread alone
He's got to have some lovin' each and every night
And a woman's got to have it if the truth be known
Let's get together honey, it's alright
