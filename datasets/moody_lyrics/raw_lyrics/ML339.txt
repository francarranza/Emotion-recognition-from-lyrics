I remember when you said your father's asleep
I remember swimming as our clothes drifted off to sea.

So wake up, wake up dreaming,
And lie here with me,
So wake up, wake up dreaming,
And lie here with me.

Here we go,
Just lose control and let your body give in,
To the beat,
Of your heart as my hand touches your skin,
Is this love
Or,
Just sexual desire,
We're gonna start a fire!

I remember drinking as the stars were falling,
I remember dancing on the hotel's unmade bed.

So wake up, wake up dreaming,
And lie here with me,
So wake up, wake up dreaming,
And lie here with me.

Here we go,
Just lose control and let your body give in,
To the beat,
Of your heart as my hand touches your skin,
Is this love
Or,
Just sexual desire,
We're gonna start a fire!

Here we go,
Just lose control and let your body give in,
To the beat,
Of your heart as my hand touches your skin,
Is this love
Or,
Just sexual desire,
We're gonna start a fire!

Taking chances in the back of your car,
We burn and on my radio is "Rockin' in a Free World,
S.O.S.
So obsessed,
Oh you make me such a mess,
Why can't this just last forever, why, why, why?

So wake up, wake up dreaming,
And lie here with me,
So wake up, wake up dreaming,
And lie here with me.

Here we go,
Just lose control and let your body give in,
To the beat,
Of your heart as my hand touches your skin,
Is this love
Or,
Just sexual desire,
We're gonna start a fire!
We're gonna start a fire!
We're gonna start a fire!
We're gonna start a fire!
We're gonna start a fire!

Here we go,
Just lose control and let your body give in,
To the beat,
Of your heart as my hand touches your skin,
Is this love
Or,
Just sexual desire,
We're gonna start a fire!
We're gonna start a fire!
We're gonna start a fire!
We're gonna start a fire!
We're gonna start a fire!
We're gonna start a fire!
