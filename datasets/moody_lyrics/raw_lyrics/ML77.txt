It's been a long time since I rock-and-rolled
It's been a long time since I did 'The Stroll'
Ooh, let me get back, let me get back, let me get back
Mm-baby, where I come from
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Yes, it has

It's been a long time since 'The Book of Love'
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
A-carry me back, carry me back, carry me back
Mm-baby, where I come from, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh-hoh
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

Hoh, it seems so long since we 'walked in the moonlight'
Makin' vows that just couldn't work right
Haw-haw, yeah, open your arms, open your arms, open your arms
Baby, let my love come running in, a-yeah
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

Yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey
Ooh, yeah, ooh-ooh, yeah, ooh-ooh, yeah, ooh-ooh, yeah
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
