I can read the writing on the wall
You pretend that nothing's changed at all
I've got just one thing to ask you if it's so
Just take your mem'ry with you when you go

So I won't have to think about
The lonely nights I'll be without
Someone to hold me when the cold winds blow
Take your mem'ry with you when you go

I walk the floor and wonder what went wrong
I'll have to find a way to carry on
Why don't you leave before the heartache starts to show
Take your mem'ry with you when you go

I won't have to think about
The lonely nights I'll be without
Someone to hold me when the cold winds blow
Take your mem'ry with you, so I won't have to miss you
Just take your mem'ry with you when you go
