In the sweet old country where I come from 
Nobody ever works 
Yeah nothing gets done 
We hang fire, we hang fire 

You know marrying money is a full time job 
I don't need the aggravation 
I'm a lazy slob 
I hang fire, I hang fire 
Hang fire, put it on the wire 

We've got nothing to eat 
We got nowhere to work 
Nothing to drink 
We just lost our shirts 
I'm on the dole 
We ain't for hire 
Say what the hell 
Say what the hell, hang fire 
Hang fire, hang fire, put it on the wire 
Doo doo doo 

Take a thousand dollars go have some fun 
Put it all on at a hundred to one 
Hang fire, hang fire, put it on the wire
