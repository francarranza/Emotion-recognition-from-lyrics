Another lonely night
I think if I'm lucky I'll get into a fight
I hate everything I see
It's a different city with the same old scene
A waste of space
Then what a surprise
Through the dull conversations and glazed over eyes
There you were in all your glory
I could tell that you wouldn't bore me

Oh I
I hate people
But I
I like you
Oh I
I hate people
And you
You do too

I was walking
Around wanting to die
Thought I wouldn't make it through the night if I try
But I saw you standing there
In your torn leather jacket and dark brown hair
You were different
From all the rest
My eyes saw only yours and that big mess
As I pushed past the people to get to you
I saw in your eyes that you already knew

Oh I
I hate people
But I
I like you
Oh I
I hate people
And you
You do too

I thought that we could get together
I thought that we could have some fun
Just the two of us
Alone together
Hating everyone!

Oh I
I hate people
But I
I like you
Oh I
I hate people
And you
You do too
