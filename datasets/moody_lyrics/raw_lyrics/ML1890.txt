Long, long and lonely nights, (Doo-doo-doo-doo)
I cry my eyes out over you. (Doo-doo-doo-doo)
Wond'ring if I did right
And why you left me with a broken heart

Oh, long, long and lonely nights, (Doo-doo-doo-doo)
Oh, how I miss you, my dear. (Doo-doo-doo-doo)
Please, please come back to me
How I wish you were here. (Ah)

As I go along my lonely way
I visualize your face
When I pass through, (Where?), my doorway
(Ding-dong)
What's left for me to face?
(Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya)

Oh, long, long and lonely nights, (Doo-doo-doo-doo)
I guess you're never coming home. (Doo-doo-doo-doo)
Long, long and lonely nights
Ever since you've been gone. (Ah)

As I go along my lonely way
I visualize your face
When I pass through (Where?) my doorway
(Ding-dong)
What's left for me to face?
(Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya)

Oh, long, long and lonely nights, (Doo-doo-doo-doo)
I guess you're never coming home. (Doo-doo-doo-doo)
Long, long and lonely nights
Ever since you've been gone. (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah)

Please, please, come back to me
You've been gone too long
