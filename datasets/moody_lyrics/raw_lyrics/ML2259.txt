Here's a copy of the lesson you know
And put the kind words to bed
For man don't say why or even know how
It's only awful as the hell that you know

When eyelids want to close
Eyelids want to close
They'll know how
Yeah, they'll know how

And only hours before the house had burned down
He shut the other door
But if I don't see now or even know why
It's only awful as the hell that you know

When eyelids want to close
Eyelids want to close
They'll know how
Yeah, they'll know how

Home, home, home
Home, home, home
Home, home
Home, home

He was writing in the lesson you know
Let's take the other door
Now if I don't think right or even know how
It's only awful as the hell that you know

When eyelids want to close
Eyelids want to close
They'll know how
Yeah, they'll know how

Home, home, home
Home, home, home
Home, home
Home, home
