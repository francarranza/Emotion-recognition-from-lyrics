Spirit of the rising sun lift me up
Hold me there and never let me fall
Love me till I die, my heart won't wait
Soon I will be loved

In this love song, love
Love song, love song

Hey, hey
Love won't find, find its own way home

In this love song, love
Love, love song

Sun shine, sun shine on me
Sun shine, sun shine on me

In this love song, love
Love song, love song

Hey, hey
Love won't find, find its own way home

In this love song, love song
Love song, love song

Sun shine on me
Bring it through to my heart
I would give you everything
I will give you my desire

Sun shine, sunshine on me
Sun shine, sunshine on me
