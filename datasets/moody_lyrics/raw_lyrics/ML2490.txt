Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
I got orders from my baby
Not to come home juiced no more
I stop by a fence to visit with a friend of mine
I just dropped in for a minute
But I over stayed my time

Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
I got orders
Don't you come home drunk no more

Why oh why does whiskey
Make me lose my head
Got me sitting at a bar
When I should be home in bed

Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
I got orders from my baby
Not to come home drunk no more

Yeah whiskey every morning
Whiskey every night
As long as I got my whiskey
Everything's alright

Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
Let me go home whiskey, let me walk out that door
I got orders from my baby
Don't you come home drunk no more
