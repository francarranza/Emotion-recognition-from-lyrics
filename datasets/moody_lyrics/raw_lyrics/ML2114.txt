Blue skies smilin' at me
Nothin' but blue skies do I see
Bluebirds singin' a song
Nothin' but bluebirds all day long

I never saw the sun shinin' so bright
Never saw things goin' so right
Noticin' the days hurryin' by
When you're in love, my how they fly

Blue days all of them gone
Nothin' but blue skies from now on

Blue skies smilin' at me
Nothin' but blue skies do I see
Bluebirds singin' a song
There's nothin' but bluebirds all day long

I never saw the sun shinin' so bright
Never saw things goin' so right
Noticin' the days hurryin' by
When you're in love, oh my how they fly

Bye blue days all of them gone
Nothin' but blue skies from now on
