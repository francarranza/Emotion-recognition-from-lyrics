Could've been like before
Could've had to lock the door

Make your mind
Let the door, let the door swing
Only one
Only one to let the door

Wanted to pretend he's dead
Didn't have to pretend

Make your mind
Let the door, let the door swing
Only one
Only one to let the door
All this and more
Makes no sense to me
All this and more
Makes me drown

Let me know if it's alright
Let me know if you just might

Make your mind
Let the door, let the door swing
Only one
Only one to let the door
All this and more
Makes no sense to me
All this and more
Makes no sense to me
All this and more
Makes no sense to me
All this and more
Makes me drown
