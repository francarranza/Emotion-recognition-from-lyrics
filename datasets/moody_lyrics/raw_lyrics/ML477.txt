New York snow this time of year
There's nothing more beautiful to me
Except for you
Making my way uptown and down
Seeing familiar places and faces
In my pile of coffee grounds

The days are better, the nights are still so lonely
Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road
Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road

Watching my breath rise in the sun
Pulling myself in to make one
Hopelessly feel for my phone and drive away
This new rhythm I pursue
Is just my getting over you
Or telling myself that I need to

The days are better, the nights are still so lonely
Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road
Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road

I'm still looking for a fare
No one said that it was fair...
To be alone

The days are better, the nights are still so lonely
Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road
The days are better, the nights are still so lonely
Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road
Sometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road.
