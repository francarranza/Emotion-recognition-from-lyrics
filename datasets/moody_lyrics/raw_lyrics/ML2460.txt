If I ever leave you... you can say I told you so!
And if I ever hurt you baby... you know I hurt myself as well.

Is that any way for a man to carry on
Do you think I want his little loved one gone
I love you baby
More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

When I wasn't making to much money
You know where my paycheck went
You know I brought it home to baby
And I never spent one red cent

Is that any way for a man to carry on
Do you think he wants his little loved one gone
I love you baby
More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

I'm not trying to be
Any kind of man
I'm trying to be somebody
You can love, trust and understand
I know that I can be
Yeah
A part of you that no one else could see

I just wanna hear, a hear ya say
It's all right
Yeah yeah

Only flesh and blood
But I can be everything that you demand
I can be president of general motors baby
Or just a tiny little grain of sand

Is that anyway for a man to carry on
Do you think he wants his little loved one gone
I love you baby, I love you baby
I love youMore than you'll ever know

If I ever leave you... you can say I told you so!
And if I ever hurt you ... you know I hurt myself as well.

Is that anyway for a man to carry on
Do you think he wants his little loved one gone
I treid to tell ya I love you baby, I love you baby
Yeah I love you baby
I love you More than you'll ever know

I love you
I love you
I love you baby!

I told you so many times before
I love you
I love
