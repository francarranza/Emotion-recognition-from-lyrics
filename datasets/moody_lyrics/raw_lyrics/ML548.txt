(Featuring Eddie Levert)

All your friends are telling you
You should have a fancy car and diamond rings
But Girl you know all good things come in time

Girl you know I'll do just about anything
To see a smile upon your face
So don't let your friends go messing with
Your mind

Girl you know there ain't nothing
I won't do for you and Baby don't
Don't ever doubt my love 'cause it's true

Baby hold on to me
See I'm a special kind
A man that is hard to find
Told you a thousand times
Baby hold on to me

Repeat 1

Oh Girl wasn't I there when he made you cry
And who was there to comfort you
When he said bye bye bye bye bye Baby

Girl I give you my time here is my money
All of my heart and you'll be so sorry Baby
If we were to ever part
And Girl you know
That I would never hurt you
And Girl you know
That I would never desert you

Better hold on to me
See I'm a special knid
A man that is hard to find
Told you a thousand times
Baby hold on to me

Repeat 1

I wanna be everything that you need
And I promise yes I promise Baby
To be there for you baby

Repeat 1

(Ad lib)

Repeat 1 three times
