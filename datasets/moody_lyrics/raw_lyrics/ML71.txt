So we live in our old van
Travel all across this land
Me and you

And We'll end up hand in hand
Somewhere down on the sand
Just Me and you

Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be

Drive until the city lights
Dissolve into a country sky
Just Me and you

Lay underneath the
Harvest moon
Do all the things
That lovers do
Just me and you

Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
