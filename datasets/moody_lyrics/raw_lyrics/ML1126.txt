Who wants to own dead wood walls or anything at all
I wash only to get dirty again
I speak only to forget what I said

Take care of me
Wrap me up
Shake me down
When I fall into myself

I'll pull you up and catch you when you fall
All was bright when I met you
Helpless little creature
When I'm away, I'm with you

Take care of me
Wrap me up
Shake me down
When I fall into myself
