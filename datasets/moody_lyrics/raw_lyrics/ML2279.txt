Your love is so strong
It cracks at the slightest touch
Your love is so strong
Like nothing it crumbles to dust, to dust

Your love is so strong
And it breaks and [Incomprehensible] in pain
Your love is so strong
Like nothing it melts in the rain

Your love is so wide
Black on every tide, every side

Your love is strong
It shatters at the slightest hum
Your love is so strong
Like nothing it melts in the sun, in the sun

Your love is so strong
It's only a fear in your eyes
Your love is so strong
It's only a series of lies

My love is so lost, I'll sell at any cost
Your love is the seed
It's the promise I need to be deceived
I need to be deceived, to be deceived

You're all that I need
I'll love you so long
Your love is so strong
