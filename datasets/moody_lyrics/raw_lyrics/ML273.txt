Give me words to speak
Don't let my spirit sleep
'Cause I can't think of anything worth saying
But I know that I owe you my life
Give me words to speak Don't let my spirit sleep...

Just Don't understand
Just Don't understand
Just Don't understand these lies I've been believing

Give me words to speak, don't let my spirit sleep
