Since 1989 it seems that everyone's
Forgotten the time when
Intercontinental ballistics ruled the
World and the cold war raged

(Chorus:) Nuclear Family Nuclear War (4x)

Alarming to me it seems that ignorance
Is still a disease and how so many
Haven't a clue or a care about the threat
That still hangs over our heads

Burning in the aftermath (4x)
