You think you know me
You don't know shit
I've seen the world through your eyes
And it makes me sick
I question all of your answers
They're fucking lies
I won't conform to your system
I'd rather die

I burn it down
Just to watch it go
I burn it down
So everybody knows
I burn it down
Just to see it torched
I burn it down
I hate it to the core

You think you're a martyr
Not hard to see
You wanna rule the fucking world
You've gotta get through me
Your iron fist will be broken
No soul to sell
You think I'll burn for my actions
See you in hell

I burn it down
I do it for myself
I burn it down
For me and no one else
I burn it down
Just to watch it fall
I burn it down
I hate you fucking all
