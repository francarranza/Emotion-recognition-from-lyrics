Despite is what I teach
Is what I fear
Is what I preach
War is what I bring
Is what I do
I do for you
Hate is what I learned
Is what I leave when I return

Crush down all you fear
Cause you don't understand
Eliminate the opposite
Make enemies and friends your slaves

A border is just a line on the cards of the weak
A crime is just a crime if you get sentenced for it

The world is my audience on screens I dictate
Its actors my puppets
Slaves of the state

Despite is what I teach
Is what I fear
Is what I preach
War is what I bring
Is what I do
I do for you
Hate is what I learned
Is what I leave when I return

Crush down all you fear
Cause you don't understand
Eliminate the opposite
Make enemies and friends your slaves

On my own stage I pull the strings
I write the tragedy
Everybody obeys my will
I write the tragedy
Nobody wins

Sorrow is my profit
Finally death is what I sell
Hate is my business and I create your hell
Do you know who I am?

Crush down all you fear
Cause you don't understand
Eliminate the opposite
Make enemies and friends

I am the illusionist
Satan and God
The world is my playground
And freedom is my fraud
