Well still try
Remember what it was that made you sad
And you'll be glad to know that I already know
So don't feel bad 'cause I don't feel sad
Well maybe I'm a little bit upset
You never had to lead me on 'cause it just made me feel stupid

I'm glad that you never said goodbye
I'll try not to care anymore
Don't worry, it happens all the time
Who ever knew
I wish you were here
Remind me of the time

Feel so dumb

I still have some of your things
I still have some things of yours
