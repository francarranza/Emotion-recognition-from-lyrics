I couldn't love you more
If time was running out
Couldn't love you more
Oh right now baby

Take me by the hand come on
Be my darling be the one
I wouldn't want to lay or ever love with another
If everyone in the world
Could give me what I wanted
I wouldn't want for more than I have
I couldn't love you more if I tried

I couldn't love you more boy
I couldn't love you more boy

'Cause darling I'm on your side
I really am on your side
My love I'm on your side
Oh right now baby

I couldn't love you more boy
Stay exactly how your are
I couldn't love you more boy
Couldn't love you more
I couldn't love you more boy
Stay exactly how your are
I couldn't love you more boy
Couldn't love you more

If everyone in the world
Would give me their treasure
I would not want for more
Than I have right now
