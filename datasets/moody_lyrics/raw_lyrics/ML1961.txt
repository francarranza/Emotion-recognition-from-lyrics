Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

I don't wanna kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny, try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just wanna dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

Just to dance with you
Is everything I need (oh-oh)
Before this dance is through (oh)
I think I'll love you too (oh-oh)
I'm so happy when you dance with me (oh-oh ohh)

If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

Just to dance with you (oh-oh)
Is everything I need (oh-oh)
Before this dance is through (oh)
I think I'll love you too (oh-oh)
I'm so happy when you dance with me (oh-oh ohh)

If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I've discovered I'm in love with you
(Oh)
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
(Oh-oh)
(Oh-oh)
(Oh)
