Ruler of my heart
Robber of my soul
Where can you be?
I wait patiently

My heart cries out
Pain inside
Where can you be?
I wait patiently

When you're alone
The going gets rough
Come back, come back, come back, baby
I've had enough

Make me a queen
Happy again
Hear my cry
And ease my pain

When you're alone
Going gets rough
Come back, come back, come back, baby
I have had enough

Make me a queen
Happy again
Hear me cry
Ease my pain
