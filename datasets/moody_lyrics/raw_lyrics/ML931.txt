If you do want me, gimme little sugar
If you don't want me, don't lead me on girl
But if you need me, show me that you love me
And when I'm feeling blue and I want you
There's just one thing that you should do

Just gimme some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby
To show me that you're mine girl
Oh yeah

Just gimme some kind of sign girl
Oh my darling
To show me that you're mine girl
All right

If you do want me, gimme little sweet talk
If you don't want me, don't lead me on girl
But if you need me, show me that you love me
And when I'm feeling down, wearing a frown
You be there when I look around

Just gimme some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby
To show me that you're mine girl
All right

Just gimme some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby
To show me that you're mine girl
All right

...

Just gimme some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby
To show me that you're mine girl
Oh yeah

Just gimme some kind of sign girl
Oh my darling
To show me that you're mine girl
All right

Just gimme some kind of sign, sign

Just gimme some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby
To show that you're mine girl
Oh yeah...
