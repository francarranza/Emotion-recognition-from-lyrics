Love is dead dance is dead
Pop is dead grunge is dead
Rhythm and blues is dead
Punk rock music is dead
Heavy metal is dead
And rock and roll is dead

House is dead ska is dead
Jazz is dead glam is dead
Tin pan alley is dead
That motown sound is dead
Reggae music is dead
And rock and roll is dead

We didn't wanna lose you
To the barrel of a gun
Don't let the drugs confuse you
Maybe love will overcome
Everyone and push that feeling on

Coke is dead, speed is dead
Crack is dead, weed is dead
Ecstasy is dead, LSD is dead
Heroine is dead and Jesus is dead

We didn't wanna lose you
To the barrel of a gun
Don't let the drugs confuse you
Maybe love will overcome
Everyone and push that feeling on


John is dead Jim is dead
James is dead Michael dead
Janice Joplin is dead
Robert Johnson is dead
Jimmy Hendrix is dead
And Elvis is dead

Sid is dead Nat is dead
Kurt is dead Marvin dead
Nina Simone is dead
Rory Gallagher is dead
Frank Sinatra is dead
And love is dead

We didn't wanna lose you
To the barrel of a gun
Don't let the drugs confuse you
Maybe love will overcome
Everyone and push that feeling on, love is dead
We didn't wanna lose you, love is dead
We're still reaching for the sun, love is dead
Don't let the drugs confuse you, love is dead
Maybe love will overcome
Everyone and push that feeling on.
