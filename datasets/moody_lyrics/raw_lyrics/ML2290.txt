Count my fingers ten
Dressed to kill and think again
Count my fingers nine
Do the math your sacrifice
Son of a bitch should bleed awhile

Fighting under style
Sleeping under death awhile
Gladiators ring
Sharpening my blade to sting
Son of a bitch your fate I'll bring

Profit melee are all mesmerized
All betray the bastard samurai
Profit melee on this killing floor
All betray the bastard samurai

Bastard samurai
Bastard samurai

The killer I've become
Tattoo heart yakuza's thumb
Killing men aside
Severed heads abide
Son of a bitch should bleed awhile

Bastard samurai
Bastard samurai

Count my fingers ten
Dressed to kill and think again
Count my fingers nine
