Now that it Christmas time
And if you say you would be mine,
It would be Christmas every day.
And baby I'm in love in you,
And if you say you love me too,
It would be Christmas everyday.

What a lovely Christmas!
Christmas in the winter time
When the snow falls on the ground.
I said Christmas, Christmas in the summer time
If I had you around.
Christmas in the spring time
And baby that ain't all:
If I had you to say you love me too
It would be Christmas even in the fall.

I wrote and told Santa Claus I needed you because it would Christmas everyday
And I would have the Christmas spirit all though the year
It would be Christmas everyday.

Christmas everyday!
Everyday would be Christmas
Christmas everyday!
Lady if I had you.
Christmas everyday!
A Christmas everyday
Christmas everyday!

I wrote and told Santa Claus I needed you because it would Christmas everyday.
And I would have that Christmas spirit all though the year;
It would be Christmas everyday.

Christmas, Christmas in the winter time,
When the snow falls on the ground.
What a lovely Christmas,
Christmas in the summer time
A when it's hot we'll still have fun
A lovely Christmas
Christmas in the spring time!
When the little birdies sing
You got me walking got me talking 'bout Christmas
Christmas in the fall time!
I got that Christmas spirit.
Everyday, everyday!
Christmas everyday!
Everyday!
Christmas everyday!
Everyday, everyday!
Christmas everyday!
