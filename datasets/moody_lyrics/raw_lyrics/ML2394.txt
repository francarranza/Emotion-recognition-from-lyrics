She was sellin' Holy Bible, lordy
She was lookin' at me. yeah
She said you know, boy, I can save your soul
For a price I'll have you knockin' on heavens door

But I, Get it for free
She said, invest in the lord and you'll invest in me

I said I, I get it for free
I, I, I, I get it for free

Done gone, but I forgot
For got what she was selling
I really took me something back
How to get to heaven,
But I, I get it for free

I got an angel in the back and she gives it to me
Well I, I Get it for free
I, I, I,

Come on back when you have something to sell
That I don't already have
Maybe you'll come back when my old lady
Is out of town
Then I'll take you straight to heaven
