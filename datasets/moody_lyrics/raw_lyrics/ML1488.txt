You're a dirty robot, you're a dirty robot

No, I don't care for your metal looks
I don't care for your bleeps and bloops
Go away, why don't you just shut up?

Your crazy smile, digital dial
I hate your every bolt and screw
I don't like anything about you

You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot

Yes, everyday I've been thinking 'bout you
In my dreams, we've been making out
Isn't that what human life's about? No

My circuitry comes off the scale
Baby, got the hots for you
My index sent a shock right through
My body needs you, my body needs you

You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot

You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
You're a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
You're a dirty robot, you're a dirty robot

I'm a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
I'm a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
I'm a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
I'm a dirty robot, I'm a dirty robot
I'm a dirty robot
