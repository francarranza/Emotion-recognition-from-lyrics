California is a great big nation of one
They never knew what they wanted till it was already gone
What do they do with the light in the morning
When they wake up alone
They just go home, they just go home

You're the nicest, nicest boy I've ever met and then
I think about you, then I think about you again
And again
Why don't we just sit and stare and do nothing?
Nothing at all for a while
I like the way you smile

I could be your state and I could be your nation
It doesn't get better than home, now, does it?
It doesn't get better than home, now, does it?
It doesn't get better than home, now, does it?
It doesn't get better than home, now, does it?

It's a comfort to me

I could be your welcome, I could be your greeter
I could be sweet, and I could be sweeter
I want to be where your heart is home
I want to be where your heart is home
I want to be where your heart is home

It's a comfort to me

I want to see you with the light in the morning
There's never been such a beautiful morning to me, to me
Why don't we just sit and stare and do nothing?
Nothing at all for a while
I like the way you smile

I could be your state and I could be your nation
It doesn't get better than home, now, does it?
It doesn't get better than home, now, does it?
It doesn't get better than home, now, does it?
It doesn't get better than home, now, does it?

It's a comfort to me

I could be your welcome, I could be your greeter
I could be sweet, and I could be sweeter
I want to be where your heart is home
I want to be where your heart is home
I want to be where your heart is home

It's a comfort to me

I want to be where your heart is home
I want to be where your heart is home
I want to be where your heart is home

I want to be where your heart is home...
