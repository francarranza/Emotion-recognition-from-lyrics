Oh, how is it we are cursed and reduced to this pandemonium?
Screams of the beings through the ash that I can see
Now do I beg the question, question the aggression
Of the suffering to be?
Why the single spark that made the flame that set this blaze

A blaze a blaze to quell our light and ignite the sky

The flames that hold us
Are the same that hold the night
This was meant to choke the light
'Cause this is a fire this is a firefight

No remorse or regret
Ravenous contempt for the lives now spent
Now kiss the blaze and cry
This is a fire this is a firefight

The flames that hold us
Are the same that hold the night
This was meant to choke the light
'Cause this is a fire this is a firefight

No remorse or regret
Ravenous contempt for the lives now spent
Now kiss the blaze and cry
This is a fire this is a firefight

The plume of black ash so gently caresses the sky
To the world I knew I say goodbye there are no more questions now
The lashes of flickering pain incandescent luminescent
As the brightest day, I feel my spirit slipping away

The flames that hold us
Are the same that hold the night

This was meant to choke the light
'Cause this is a fire this is a firefight
No remorse or regret

Ravenous contempt for the lives now spent
Now kiss the blaze and cry
This is a fire this is a firefight

No mercy shown or debt was owed for what I cannot dream
The reason for this wrath bestowed by flame beyond the sea
Tonight I've heard the cry and swear by all I've seen
That vengeance will one day be mine satisfaction will I breathe

Have you seen your who world build from ash to ashes return

The flames that hold us
Are the same that hold the night
This was meant to choke the light
'Cause this is a fire this is a firefight

No remorse or regret
Ravenous contempt for the lives now spent
Now kiss the blaze and cry
This is a fire this is a firefight

The flames that hold us
Are the same that hold the night
This was meant to choke the light
'Cause this is a fire this is a firefight

No remorse or regret
Ravenous contempt for the lives now spent
Now kiss the blaze and cry
This is a fire this is a firefight
