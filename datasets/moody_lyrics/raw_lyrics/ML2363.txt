The teleprompter is read
By the telegenic dead
And it goes out across the nation
There ain't no war information

The bravest kids I know
Are the ones that got to go
Fighting over there (x2)

All channels pre-empted
Another socialite is gonna get arrested
Pop culture transition
Taking over my television

The bravest kids I know
Are the ones that got to go
Fighting over there (x2)
