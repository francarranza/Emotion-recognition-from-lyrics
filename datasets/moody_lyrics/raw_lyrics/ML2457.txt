Can I touch you to see if you're real?
Cause in nothing there's something I feel,
Can my heart take the strain?
Or will it break down again?

In your lips I sense a danger
And you've got the eyes of a stranger.

Have I been sleeping for all these years?
Is it magic that makes you appear?
When I stepped in the room I felt my heart race
But you acted rude when I looked at your face

In your lips I sense a danger
You've got the eyes of a stranger
In your lips I see a danger
You've got the eyes of a stranger

You've got that look in your eyes
Your eyes, You've got that look in your eyes
In your eyes

In your lips I sense a danger
And you've got the eyes of a stranger
In your lips I see a danger
And you've got the eyes of a stranger
You've got the eyes of a stranger
And you've got the eyes of a stranger
You've got the eyes of a stranger
You've got the eyes of a stranger
