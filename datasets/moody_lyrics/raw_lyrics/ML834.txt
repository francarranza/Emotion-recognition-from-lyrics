Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironing out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know

Turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much

If someone else is suffering enough to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

So turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much

Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say so much

So turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
You know, sad songs say so much

When all hope is gone
You know, sad songs say so much
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When everything you do is going wrong
Sad songs say so much
