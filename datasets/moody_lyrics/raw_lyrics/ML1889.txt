We can be like they are, we can be free
We can be like they are, we can be free
Free to be evil, free to believe
Free to be slaves now to this silver machine

We can be like they are, we can be free
We can be like they are, we can be free
Free to eat the fruit from the evil tree
Free to be one now with this silver machine

Can it help us? Yes, yes, yes, yes
