You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize, all others above
So worth the yearning for
So worth keeping the home fires burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together that it's
It does seem a shame
That you can't see your future with me
'Cause you'd be oh so easy to love

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together that
It does seem a shame
That you can't see your future with me
'Cause you'd be oh so easy to love
