It was the usual crowd growing up
All good, all bad, all ugly
They were like brothers 'cause we all felt the same
The future tore them away

Born with our senses keen, hope and fear
With a sense of danger and demise
The world will numb everything, hope and fear
A negative discipline, a vacuum

What evil force dragged them down?
What demon singled them out?
What evil took them away?
Allowing only two choices

So tell me
Was there a secret never shared with others?
Was there a hidden trauma?
What made the bonds break?
What caused the mistakes?
Why was the criminal life so desired?

Born with our senses keen, hope and fear
With a sense of danger and demise
The world will numb everything, hope and fear
A negative discipline, a vacuum

From afar, bleak reports trickle in
But the world has spread apart, the world has spread apart
All the promise that was held now is wasted
The soul is delicate, the walls have crippled it
From afar, troubled lives lose their purpose
The world has given up, the world has given up
The world has finally forsaken its sons

What evil force dragged them down?
What demon singled them out?
What evil took them away?
Allowing only the choice between
Death or jail
