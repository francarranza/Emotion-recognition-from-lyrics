Still by the window pane
Pain like the rain that's falling
She waits in the air, Matte Kudasai
She sleeps in a chair in her sad America

When, when was a night so long?
Long like the notes I'm sending
She waits in the air, Matte Kudasai
She sleeps in a chair in her sad America

She waits in the air, Matte Kudasai
She sleeps in a chair in her sad America
