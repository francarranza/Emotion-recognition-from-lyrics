I see the state of the world and it grieves me
I hear the cries of the broken of the rich and poor
Smell the fear of disease all around me now

I feel responsible now that I see
'Cause we all approve to live for more than this
More than this

So I want to love like love
Love like you love want to love others
The way you love me

So I want to love like love
Love like you love want to love others
The way you love me

I've held the children unseen and they move me
I wonder what I can do to improve a thousand lives
I feel the absence of love and it scares me

I feel responsible now that I see
'Cause we all were born to live for more than this
So much more than this

So I want love like you love
Love like you love, want to love others
The way you love me

I've was that lost so that have been rescued
I was the orphaned hat you adopted and brought into your home
I was the, the equated with the hopelessness
That was living in the streets, that was me

Now I'm gonna love like you love
Love like you love, help me love others
The way you love me

I'm gonna forgive, how you forgave
And rescue you have saved
Others, others, others, others, others
The way you love me, the way you love me

You first loved me, that's why I love you
'Cause you first loved me
Yeah, you first loved me
