Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on
Our troubles will be out of sight (my Lord)

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on
Our troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years
We all will be together
If the Fates allow (allow)
Hang a shining star
Upon the highest bough
And have yourself
A merry little Christmas right now

(Have yourself a)
Have yourself a
(Merry little Christmas)
A merry little Christmas
(Have yourself a)
Oh
(Merry Christmas now)

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on
Our troubles will be miles away, ooh

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us 
Gather near to us once more

Through the years
We all will be together
If the Fates allow (allow)
Hang a shining star
Upon the highest bough ooh ooh
And have yourself
Let your heart be light
Ooh have yourself
Put your troubles out of sight
Ooh just have yourself
A merry little Christmas now

(Have yourself a merry little Christmas)
(Have yourself a merry Christmas now)
Have yourself a merry, merry Christmas
(Have yourself a merry little Christmas)
Have merry, merry, merry, merry, merry ooh
(Have yourself a merry Christmas now)
A merry little Christmas
(Have yourself)
Have yourself a merry little
(Have yourself a merry little Christmas)
(Have yourself)
Have yourself
(Have yourself a merry Christmas now)
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Ooh ooh
