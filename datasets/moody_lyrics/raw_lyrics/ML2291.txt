I ain't got no horse
I ain't got no horizon
Just the scars on my eyes
I swear I got from crying

Where I was born it don't matter
There ain't no going back
I have no home to take you
I never dream like that

Sit and watch my cigarette smoking on itself
Sit and watch my cigarette smoking on itself
Sit and watch my cigarette smoking on itself
And I think, what the hell, hell, hell

I don't want you to like me
There's no way that you can
I don't want you to touch me, honey
I am just so mad

There ain't no kind of feeling
All my chords are flicked out
I'm just living and breathing
For what I steal for myself

Sit and watch my cigarette smoking on itself 
Sit and watch my cigarette smoking on itself 
Sit and watch my cigarette smoking on itself 
And I think, what the hell, hell, hell
