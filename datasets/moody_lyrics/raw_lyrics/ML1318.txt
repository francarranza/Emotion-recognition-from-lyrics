Don't give me that look don't show me
Those tears
I don't believe 'em
I gave you my love I've had it to here
With all your cheatin'

You never believed I would find you out
It took some time I know what you're about

Kiss my love goodbye
I've had it with your lyin'
Kiss my love goodbye
You weren't even tryin'
You never thought about anyone else
You were just takin' care of your self
You were never mine
So kiss my love goodbye

You're harder than nails and baby I know
What's on your mind
That little girl smile has turned me around
(Saved your skin)
Not this time

I was breakin' my back tryin' to be there
For you I got news... you can

Kiss my love goodbye
I've had it with your lyin'
Kiss my love goodbye
You weren't even tryin'
You never thought about anyone else
You were just takin' care of your self
You were never mine
So kiss my love goodbye

Don't tell me that your heart is breakin'
Cause this time baby I ain't takin'

Don't mess up that pretty face
Can't you see it's just too late
This time baby you went too far
I see you now for what you are

Kiss my love goodbye
I've had it with your lyin'
Kiss my love goodbye
You weren't even tryin'
You never thought about anyone else
You were just takin' care of your self
You were never mine
So kiss my love goodbye
