Much has been written about
The world and all its kind of loves
But the sweetest of them all
You seldom will find stories of, oh oh oh oh

My love lives outside my window
Clouds burst to give water
So her love can grow, oh
My love smiles to me each morning
Says she'll never leave me and I know it's so

You don't have to look around
Or ask yourself if she is there
'Cause the fragrance of her love
Says hi with every breath of air, oh oh oh oh

You will often hear her name
Describing another's prettiness
But if ever there was choice
My flower would be the prettiest, oh oh oh oh

My love lives outside my window
Clouds burst to give water
So her love can grow, oh
My love smiles to me each morning
Says she'll never leave me and I know it's so
