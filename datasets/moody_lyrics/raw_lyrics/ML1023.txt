You keep me comin' home again
You keep me comin' home again

When you were gone, I met a friend
She taught me how to live in the end

You keep me comin' home again
You keep me comin' home again

Are her eyes brown or blue?
How does she keep her static cool?
My heart and soul are rocked up in her eyes
A little blink I, I recognize
A little blink, yeah that's my prize
A white horse sittin' right there by her side
Hard to ignore, hard to disguise
When will she ever realize?

You keep me coming home again
You keep me coming home again

When you were gone, I was out of my mind
I had a friend who laughed all the time
I had a friend who cried all the time
I had a friend who screamed all the time
I had a friend who lied all the time
