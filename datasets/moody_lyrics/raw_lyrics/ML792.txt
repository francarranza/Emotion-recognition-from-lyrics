Anyone who ever loved
Could look at me
And know that I love you
Anyone who ever dreamed
Could look at me
And know I dream of you

Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You, you couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me
Like you hurt me
And be so untrue
What am I to do

Every time you go away
I always say it's good bye dear
Loving you the way I do
I take you back
Without you I'd die dear
Knowing I love you so

Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You, you couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me
Like you've hurt me
And be so untrue
So what can I do

Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me 
Like you hurt me
And be so untrue

Anyone who had a heart
Would love me too
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me in her arms
And, and always love me, and love me, love me
Why won't you

Anywone who had a heart
Would love me too
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me in her arms 
And always love me, love me 
Then why won't you

Anyone who had a heart
Would love me too
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me
Anyone would take me
Why, why won't you
No one's gonna love ya like I do
No one's gonna make you feel the way I do
Yeah
No one
No one, no one, no one, no one
