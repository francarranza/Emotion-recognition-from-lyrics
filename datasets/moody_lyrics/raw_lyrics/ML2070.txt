1, 2, 3

Time on your side that will never end
The most beautiful thing you can ever spend
But you work in a shirt with your name tag on it
Drifting apart like a plate tectonic

It don't matter to me
'Cause all I wanted to be
Is a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar, oh

Oh

Too much time spent dragging the past up
I didn't see you not looking when I messed up
Settling down in your early 20s
Sucked more blood than a back street dentist

It don't matter to me
'Cause all I wanted to be
Is a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar

Oh

Oh, my God, I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh, my God, I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh, my God, I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh, my God, I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home

Great ruins wait for greater glory
The only thing growing is our history
Knock me down, I'll get right back up again
I come back stronger than a powered-up Pac-Man

It don't matter to me
'Cause all I wanted to be
Was a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar

Oh

Oh, my God, I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh, my God, I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh, my God, I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh, my God, I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home

Oh
Oh
Oh, whoa

Oh, my God, I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
Oh, my God, I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh, my God, I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh, my God, I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
