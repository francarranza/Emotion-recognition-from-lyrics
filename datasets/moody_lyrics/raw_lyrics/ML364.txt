Well, I lost my heart on the day we met
But I gained a lot that I don't regret
Then I hung around 'til you said "I do"
Knew I wouldn't have nothin if I didn't have you

Well, it changed my thinkin' when you changed your name
And neither one of us will ever be the same
And I swear I'm never gonna be untrue
'Cause I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you

If I didn't have you I'd long ago
Been left in the dark, out in the cold
Blowin' around from town to town
Like a feather in the wind

If I didn't have you I know I'd be
Flounderin' around like a ship at sea
Lost in the rain of a hurricane
And that's where I'd have been

But I didn't get lost 'cause I saw your light
Shinin' like a beacon on a cold, dark night
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue
No, I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you

Well, I count my blessin's every night I pray
That the lord lets me keep you just one more day
Every day he does, 'cause God knows too
That I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you

If I didn't have you I'd long ago
Been left in the dark, out in the cold
Blowin' around from town to town
Like a feather in the wind

If I didn't have you I know I'd be
Flounderin' around like a ship at sea
Lost in the rain of a hurricane
And that's where I'd have been

But I didn't get lost 'cause I saw your light
Shinin' like a beacon on a cold, dark night
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue
No, I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you

Well, I've already said it but I swear it's true
I know I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
