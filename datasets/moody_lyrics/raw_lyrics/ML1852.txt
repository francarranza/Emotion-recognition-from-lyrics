So hold your head, and hold your tongue
But only say what you have to
And as a child yes I dreamed
Of holding her in the silver screen
She loved her man and loved him twice
I wish I'd been that passenger
Having fun, fly my kite
The devil inside won't control my life
Too much love, so little hate
The devil inside won't control my fate

Oh, if only, if only
Oh, he wasn't so lonely
He'd have someone to play with
Instead of bombing our neighbours
Yeah, yeah...

So here I go to see the world
With my eyes and with my soul
And too much love, so little hate
The devil inside won't control my fate

Oh, if only, if only
Oh, he wasn't so lonely
He'd have someone to play with
Instead of bombing our neighbours
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah!

So hold your head and run my time
The what of life no man can rhyme
So here we are and here we bleed
To be a victim there's no need
Having fun, I never fight
The devil inside controls my life
Too much love so little hate
The devil inside controls my fate

Oh, if only, if only
Oh, he wasn't so lonely
He'd have someone to play with
Instead of bombing our neighbours
