Since I met you baby my whole life has changed
Since I met you baby my whole life has changed
And everybody tells me that I am not the same

I don't need nobody to tell my troubles to
I don't need nobody to tell my troubles to
Cause since I met you baby all I need is you

Since I met you baby I'm a happy man
Since I met you baby I'm a happy man
I'm gonna try to please you in every way I can
