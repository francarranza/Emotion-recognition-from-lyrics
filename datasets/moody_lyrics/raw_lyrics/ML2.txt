I'm thinking about you
Girl I miss you
Baby ever since that day you went away
I can't live without you

You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Girl you're on my mind

I gave you all I fear
And now you're not here with me
Nothing will ever change
My love for you remains the same
I can't wait to see you again

You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Girl you're on my mind

If I don't see you today
I hope I see you tomorrow
Girl I gotta let you know how I feel
There's nothing real
And I don't want her for myself
It belongs to you right now I know 

You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Girl you're on my mind
Girl you're on my mind

Yeah you're on my mind
You're always on my mind
Girl you're on my mind
Always on my mind
