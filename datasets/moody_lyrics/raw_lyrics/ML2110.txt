Unleash the hell, you're time to live is through
Destroy lay waste, protect these gates from you, from you
We crush the weak, displace the sick for who? For you

Turn around and die, you're denied forsaken at the gates
Turn around and die, you're denied forsaken at the gates
Forsaken at the gates!

Arise dissipate, abort sujbugatem run through
Enforce constrain, displace the blame, on you
Now face your fate, we shut the door on you, on you

Turn around and die, you're denied forsaken at the gates
Turn around and die, you're denied forsaken at the gates
Forsaken at the gates!

Corpses laid out for the rapture
New world order buried in its tomb!

Corpses laid out for the rapture
New world order buried in its tomb!

Unleash the hell, you're time to live is through
Destroy lay waste, protect these gates from you, from you
Now face your fate, we shut the door on you, on you

Corpses laid out for the rapture
New world order buried in its tomb!
