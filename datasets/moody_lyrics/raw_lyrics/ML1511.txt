We may never understand
If love just happens or it's planned
We must believe our spirits know somehow
Baby, we can't stop the falling we feel now, ooh

New emotions overflow
And now this heartbeat wants control, ooh, baby
If the love was meant to be so strong
Something close to magic's coming on

Take my heart and lead me into love
Light the way for me
Without your touch, I cannot see
Lead me into love
I'm deep in the miracle of you, ooh

When we feel excitement rise
We'll share the secrets found in lovers eyes
You'll speak the words of love
I'll speak them too
Baby, ain't no stopping me when I'm with you
Honey, take this heart

And lead me into love
Light the way for me
Without your touch, I cannot see
Lead me into to love
I'm deep in the miracle
(Deep in the miracle of you)
Baby, yeah

I... I keep telling you
I... Bring it too me baby
I need you, to bring me the miracle
Baby
Honey, want you
Baby I see
I tell that I'm no good
Till you show me that your desire is complete and I'm all yours

Baby, baby, baby
Oh, teach, teach me
The way baby
Deep in the miracle
Come on show me
Shine, shine your light on me
I can't see without you
I can't move without you
I can't live without you

Baby

Shine, shine your light on me
