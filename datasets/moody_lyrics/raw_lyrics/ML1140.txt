Love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled
Love that's only slightly soiled
Love for sale

Who will buy?
Who would like to sample my supply?
Who's prepared to pay the price for a trip to paradise?
Oh love for sale

Let the poets pipe of love in their childish way
You see I know every type of love better far than they
And if you want the thrill of love
I've been through the middle of love
Old love
New love
Every love but true love

I'm advertising young love for sale
If you want to try my wares
Follow me and climb the stairs
