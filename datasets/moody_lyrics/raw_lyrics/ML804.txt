Well, I know my death will not come
Till I breathe all the air out my lungs
Till my final tune is sung

That all is fleeting
Yeah, but all is good
And my love is my whole being
And I've shared what I could

But if you give a little love, you can get a little love of your own
Don't break his heart
Yeah, if you give a little love, you can get a little love of your own
Don't break his heart

Well my heart is bigger than the earth
And though life is what gave it love first
Life is not all that it's worth

'Cause life is fleeting
Yeah, but I love you
And my love surrounds you like an ether
In everything that you do

But if you give a little love, you can get a little love of your own
Don't break his heart
Yeah, if you give a little love, you can get a little love of your own
Don't break his heart

Yeah, if you give a little love, you can get a little love of your own
Don't break his heart
Yeah, if you give a little love, you can get a little love of your own
Don't break his heart

Well if you are (what you love)
And you do (what you love)
I will always be the sun and moon to you
And if you share (with your heart)
Yeah, you give (with your heart)
What you share with the world is what it keeps of you
