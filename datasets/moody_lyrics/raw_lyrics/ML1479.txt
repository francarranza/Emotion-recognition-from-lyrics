Hold me close now, hold me tight
Don't let go of me tonight
You're all I want, you're all I need
Hold me close now, hold me tight
Don't let go of me tonight
Sweet paradise, yeah

How I love all of those crazy little things
You've said and done for me
You're the one for me

Darlin', dry your eyes
I can't stand to see you cry
Now just turn and walk away
Don't look back when I say goodbye paradise

Days go by and life goes on
I feel I've been away too long
What I would give to be with you
Days go by and life drags on
Feel I've been away too long
For much too long, yeah

And all the while that I'm away
Don't let our love fade away
Don't you fade away

Now as sure as the sun is gonna shine
The day will come
Now I'm waitin' for the day
There'll be no more sayin' goodbye paradise

My sweet paradise
You are the reason why it tears me up inside
And I break down and cry
Didn't wanna say goodbye paradise

I'm comin' home to you tonight
Comin' home to you tonight
So hold on tight
Tonight I'm on my way back home to paradise

So lost without you
Can't live without you
I've been away too long, now
Tonight I'm on my way back home to you

My my paradise, my my paradise, yeah
To hold you in my arms, you're all that I adore
To see your smilin' face as I walk through the door
I'll never say goodbye again, no
