She's a dancer, a romancer
I'm a Capricorn and she's a Cancer
She saw my picture in a music magazine

When she met me, said she'd get me
Touched her hips and told me that she'd let me
I took her hand, baby this is what I said

I said, 

I'm a man, I'm no baby
And you're lookin' every inch a lady
You're good lookin' and you're lookin' like you should be good

You were distant, now you're nearer
I can feel your face inside the mirror
The lights are out and I can feel you, baby, with my hand

So baby, baby, don't you hesitate
'Cause I just can't wait
Lady, won't you take me down to my knees
You can do what you please

Come on and love me
Come on and love me
Come on and love me
Come on and love me

Baby, baby, don't you hesitate
'Cause I just can't wait
Lady, won't you take me down on my knees
You can do what you please

Come on and love me
Come on and love me
Come on and love me
Come on and love me

Come on and love me
Come on and love me
Come on and love me
Come on and love me

Come on and love me
Come on and love me
