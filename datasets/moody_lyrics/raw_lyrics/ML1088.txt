Pack up, I'm straight
Enough, oh, say, say, say
Oh, say, say, say, oh, say, say, say
Oh, say, say, say, oh, say, say, say

Wait, they don't love you like I love you
Wait, they don't love you like I love you
Maps, wait
They don't love you like I love you

Made off, don't stray
My kind's your kind, I'll stay the same
Pack up, don't stray
Oh, say, say, say, oh, say, say, say

Wait, they don't love you like I love you
Wait, they don't love you like I love you
Maps, wait
They don't love you like I love you, wait
They don't love you like I love you
Maps, wait
They don't love you like I love you

Wait, they don't love you like I love you
Wait, they don't love you like I love you
Maps, wait
They don't love you like I love you, wait
They don't love you like I love you
Maps, wait
They don't love you like I love you
