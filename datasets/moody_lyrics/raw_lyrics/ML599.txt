I can hear her heartbeat for a thousand miles
Hear the heavens open every time she smiles
And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet, I'm running to her like a river strong

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Takes my troubles away, takes away my grief
Takes away my heartache, in the night like a thief

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love

Yes I need, yes I need her in the daytime
And oh I need, yes I need her in the night
I want to throw my arms all around her
To kiss and hug and kiss and hug her tight
And oh...

And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me sweet sweet lovin', brighten up my day
It makes me righteous and it makes me whole
Makes me mellow, down into my soul

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, crazy love
One more time, she gives love, just a little love
When I wake up in the morning
She gives me love, love, love,
Crazy Love
