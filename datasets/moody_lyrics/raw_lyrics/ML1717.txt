People making lists, buying special gifts
Taking time to be kind to one and all
It's that time of year when good friends are dear
And you wish you could give more
Than just presents from a store

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?
Oh, even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would
Bring him love on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love

People you don't know smiling out hello
Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy
It's that once a year when the world's sincere
And you'd like to find a way
To show the things that words can't say

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?
The man on the street and the couple upstairs
All need to know there's someone cares
Give love on Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love

What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs your love

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?
Oh, every little child on Santa's knee
Has room for your love underneath his tree
Give love on Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love

What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs your love

Give love on Christmas Day
Oh, even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would
Bring him love on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love

What the world needs is love, yes
Give love on Christmas Day
Oh, everybody needs, we need love
Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?
No greater gift is there than love
