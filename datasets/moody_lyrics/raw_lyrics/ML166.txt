Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn
Burnin'

To my surprise, yes
One hundred stories high
People gettin' loose, y'all
You gettin' down on the roof
Let me hear

The folks was flamin'
Out of control
It was so entertainin'
When the boogie start to explode
I heard somebody say

Burn, baby, burn
Disco inferno
Burn, baby, burn
Burn that mother down
Burn, baby, burn
Disco inferno
Burn, baby, burn
Burn that mother down
Burnin'

Satisfaction (Ooh hoo hoo)
Came in a chain reaction (Burnin')
I couldn't get enough
Till I had to self-destruct (Ooh hoo hoo)

The heat was on (Burnin')
Rising to the top, mm
Everybody's goin' strong (Ooh hoo hoo)
That is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say

Burn, baby, burn
Disco inferno
Burn, baby, burn
Burn that mother down, y'all
Burn, baby, burn
Disco inferno
Burn, baby, burn
Burn that mother down
Burnin'

Up above my head
I hear music in the air
I hear music
That makes me know
There's a party somewhere

Satisfaction, mm
Came in a chain reaction
Let me hear
I couldn't get enough
So I had to self-destruct, mm

The heat was on
Rising to the top, mm
Everybody's goin' strong
That is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say

Burn, baby, burn
Disco inferno
Burn, baby, burn
Burn that mother down
Burn, baby, burn
Disco inferno, yeah
Burn, baby, burn
Burn that mother down, get it

Burn, baby, burn
Ahh...
Burn, baby, burn
Burn that mother down
Burn, baby, burn
Disco inferno
Burn, baby, burn
Burn that mother down
