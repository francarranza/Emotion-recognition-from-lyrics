This forest is growing faster than I can tell 
Cell structure eats away at a massive swell 
Seems however I'm a victim of circumstance 

Hunt for ogres and dwarves 
Lion slicer 
Run with death 
Run with death 

White faces coming closer with every step 
Earth envelops taking breath without happenstance 
Carve my teeth out ripping through the sheep's head curse 

Hunter gatherer 
Ridden from the cave 
Run with death 
Run with death 

Gone away 
My heart's gone away 
Taking everything 
My heart's gone away 
Take it now 

Run with death 
Run with death 

Gone away 
My heart's gone away 
Taking everything 
My heart's gone away 
Take it now
