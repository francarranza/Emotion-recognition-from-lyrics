I could dream of ways to see you
I could close my eyes to dream
I could fantasize about you
Tell the world what I believe
But whenever I'm not with you
It's so hard for me to see
I need to see a picture of you
A special picture just for me, yeah

So take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just send the dirty picture to me
Send the dirty picture
Just send the dirty picture to me
Send the dirty picture

Snap.
Uh.

Whenever you are gone, I just wanna be wit ya
Please don't get me wrong, I just wanna see a picture

Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture

Whenever you are gone, I just wanna be wit ya
Please don't get me wrong, I just wanna see your picture

Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture

The dream of ways to see you
I could close my eyes to dream
Fantasize about this with you
But the way is never seen

Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Just send the dirty picture to me
Send the dirty picture
Send the dirty picture to me
Send the dirty picture
