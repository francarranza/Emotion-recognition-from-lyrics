Four, three, two, one, go!

This is America, yeah, it's true
Everything else is false that was taught to me and you
But I'll try to sort it out
I'll try to sort it out

This is America, yeah, it's true
Everything else is false that was taught to me and you
But I'll try to sort it out
I'll try to sort it out with you

Did you promise the world that you'd change it?
Sounds like the way that I feel
One brick thrown, one vote alone
Won't take back everything they steal

We'll take back everything they steal

This is America, yeah, it's true
Everything else is false that was taught to me and you
But I'll try to sort it out
I'll try to sort it out

Shake it up, shake me 'til I wake from the coma
All the distance, distorted and lonely too
So out of the target
So out of the target, I'm pushing you

Promised the world that you'd change it
Sounds like the way that I feel
One brick thrown, one vote alone
Won't take back everything they steal

Everything they steal
We're all walking forward

For every treaty broken
Annihilation tokens
For every treaty broken
We'll take back everything they steal
