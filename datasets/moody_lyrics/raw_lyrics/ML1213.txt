If the sky is burning
When the clouds move in
We come so close
When we just miss

We can't see the start
We can't hide the end

Find our way to fall
Find our way to fall
Find our way to fall
Find our way to fall

I can't see between
I can't find the need
We come so close
When we just miss

Find our way to fall
Find our way to fall
Find our ways to, find our way
Find our way to fall

We can't see the start
We can't hide the end
When the sky is burning
If the clouds move in

Find our way to fall
Find our way to fall
Find our ways to, find our way
Find our way to fall

And here we are
Locked together
And here we are
Falling from the sun

And here we are
Locked together

Find our ways to, find our way
Find our way to fall
Find our ways to, find our way
Find our way to fall

Find our ways to, find our way
Find our way to fall
Find our ways to, find our way
Find our way to fall
