We came from your nightmares
And we're calling for your souls
Your endless death begins today
The Bloody Pit has final say
The Bloody Pit the bloody war
The only bloody way
The Bloody Pit of Horror
It feed on endless souls
The carnage must be unimpeded
Blood and souls are what is needed
The killing goes on day and night
We'll never fill this hole
The Bloody Pit it doesn't care
About the why, the when, the where
As guts are ripped and blood is spilled
It only knows it must be filled
And that's the way it's always been
Never change, never win

Let's make it clear
Just why we're here
It's for something more important
Thank for drinking all your beer
We're here to kill you
And claim your souls
And drape your stinking entrails round
Our numerous war-poles

Can't be called a crime
Happens every time
A gathering of ghouls
We fill the pit with blood and souls
This is the only rule

Zombies marching off to war
They've done it all before
A gathering of ghouls
Raping, slaying, heavily flaying

The Bloody Pit is pleased!
It's bursting with disease
A gathering of ghouls
Hacking and bashing
And selling drugs at school

They say that this world is going insane
But I care little, my zombies need brains
If we need more victims we'll load them in trains

All is as it was and will be lots more
The Bloody Pit of Horror
The bloody curse of war
