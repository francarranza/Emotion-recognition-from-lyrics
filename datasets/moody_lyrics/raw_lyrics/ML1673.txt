Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
Round yon virgin
Mother and Child
Holy infant
So tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night
Holy night
Shepherds quake
At the sight
Glory streams
From heaven afar
Heavenly hosts
Sing alleluia
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born
