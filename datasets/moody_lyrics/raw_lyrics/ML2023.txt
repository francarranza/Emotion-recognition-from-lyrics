When the snow is falling heavy
And you're weary from the weight
When the drift is deep
And all you see is white
May a Christmas moon surprise you
Turning snow into a stage
Showing winter diamonds
Hiding in plain sight

'Cause even heavy days have something to reveal
And the wounds remind us of the one who heals

So I say God bless us
God bless us
God bless us
Everyone, everyone

When your heart is frozen over
By a lifetime of regret
When the scars you wear
Have hardened into stone
May the spirit of the season
Come and melt the ice again
Thaw the coldest winter heart
And call it home

And if we lose sight of all that we could be
May we stumble to the one who makes us see

So I say God bless us
God bless us
God bless us
Everyone, everyone

Beauty wrapped in brokenness
Hope within the hurt
Grace is found in places
We never thought to look

When the snow is falling heavy
And you're weary from the weight
When the drift is deep
And all you see is white
May the Christmas star surprise you
Turning snow into a stage
Showing winter diamonds
Hiding in plain sight

God bless us
God bless us
God bless us
Everyone, everyone (repeat)
