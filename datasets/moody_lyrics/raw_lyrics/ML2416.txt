The atom will implode
The fragile kingdom fold
The tremor becomes a quake
And there's a body in the lake

And as the two of us rebel
Damn you all to hell
I wonder is this all there is

Time will help you through
But it doesn't have the time
To give you all the answers to the never-ending why

The sound of silence grows
As a spiders' kisses lay
The tumour becomes malign
But the kids are doing fine

And as the two of us rebel
And damn you all to hell
I wonder is this all there is

Time will help you through
But it doesn't have the time
To give you all the answers to the never-ending why
