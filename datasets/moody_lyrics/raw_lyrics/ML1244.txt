I lost you, I lost you
You slipped from your costume
Like an actress in this tragedy
You're just an apparition in this haunting mystery
I fear that you've passed over me
And there's nothing I can do because I lost you

Just like a rich man who is careless of his change
I took you for granted and then you went to strangers
From deep within my heart I feel a distant fading pulse
A poor woman looking for last coin in her purse

I lost you, I lost you
You slipped from your costume
Like an actress in this tragedy
You're just an apparition in this haunting mystery
I fear that you've passed over me
And there's nothing I can do because I lost you

Just like a counterfeit, you pass from palm to palm
I chased the one I surely loved to someone else's arms
I mislaid my senses, now that's easy to say
A fool who took his pleasure and then threw his love away

I lost you, I lost you
You slipped from your costume
Like an actress in this tragedy
You're just an apparition in this haunting mystery
I fear that you've passed over me
And there's nothing I can do because I lost you

I lost you
I lost you
