I don't want you baby
I don't need you lately
Love is ever-changing
And I think you're crazy

Oh girl, I've got to let you let you let you go
(Go go go go ...)

Let me touch your daisy
Give me what I can't be
Let tomorrow face me
Love me, kill me, change me

Oh girl, I've got to let you let you let you go

See I'm a jumper, baby
Mama, don't forsake me
Madness can't contain me
If you love me, chase me

Oh girl, I've got to let you let you let you go
Girl, I've got to let you let you let you...

Girl, I've got to let you let you let you go
