Revvin' up the engine
Listen to her howlin' roar
Metal under tension
Begging you to touch and go

Highway to the danger zone
Ride into the danger zone

Heading into twilight
Spreading out her wings tonight
She got you jumping off the deck
And shoving into overdrive

Highway to the danger zone
I'll take you right into the danger zone

They'll never say hello to you
Until you get it on the red line overload
You'll never know what you can do
Until you get it up as high as you can go

Oh, yeah!

Out along the edges
Is always where I burn to be
The further on the edge
The hotter the intensity

Highway to the danger zone
Gonna take you right into the danger zone
Highway to the danger zone
Right into the danger zone

Highway to the danger zone
Right into the danger zone
