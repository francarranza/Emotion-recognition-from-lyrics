If you leave me, I'll go crazy
If you leave me, I'll go crazy
'Cause I love you, love you
Oh, I love you too much

If you quit me, I'll go crazy
If you forget me, I'll go crazy
'Cause I love you, love you
Oh, I love you too much

You've got to live for yourself
Yourself and nobody else
You've got to live for yourself
Yourself and nobody else
