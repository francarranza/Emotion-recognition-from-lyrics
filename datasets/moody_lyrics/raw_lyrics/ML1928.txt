When you were 17 and I was 19
We feel deep in love growin' up in Queens
We didn't know a thing about love
We was innocent, sneakin' on the doorstep to hug
Held you tightly and promised you the world
You gave me hickeys and said you was my girl
When I think about it now it makes me smile
'Cause I ain't felt these butterflies in a while
Funny how you grow up and innocence fades
We used to live for love but now we're afraid
{Of what?}
Of the darkness and bitter memories
Lovers who crushed us through infidelity
I promised you I'll love you to the end
Always and forever, since way back when, uh
You're like candy,
The world's sweetest friend
You taste better now than you did back then


You will always be my candy
(Be my)
One day we will start a family
You will always be my candy girl
(You will always be my)
(You'll be my candy girl forever)
You will always be my candy
(Yes, you will)
I want your love girl understand me
(Yes, you will)
You will always be my candy girl
(I'm down for whatever)


While you suck caramel apple lollypops
Rain, sleet, or snow I'm troopin' up the Murdock
We used to walk down the block, hold hands
I would get you after school 'cause I was your man
And, any guys that want to socialize
Just know that I'mma flip on any cat that tries
My peeps used to say I was whipped
All your girls said, ¡°Since you got with him you flipped¡±
But, uh, they couldn't feel the feelings we felt
Mirrors on the ceiling we melt
I would look up at ya
I remember the afternoon you surrendered
We made love,
Your temperature was high as could be
You said, ¡°Todd, promise you ain't lyin' to me¡±
And as we went our separate ways you turned back
Smiled, I remember all that


You will always be my candy
(Be my)
One day we will start a family
(Yes, we will)
You will always be my candy girl
(Candy girl, you're my)
(My candy girl forever)
You will always be my candy
(All right)
Want your love girl understand me
(Understand me)
You will always be my candy girl
(Okay, take it to the bridge)


Candy girl
You are my world
(Are my world)
Look so sweet
You're a special treat
(Sweet)


Candy girl
All I want to say
I need your love
Each and every day


When I'm alone in my room,
Sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind,
I hear my memories call
For days when love was true,
I slept and held you
Taste the brown sugar,
Let your climax melt you
Candy,
You're occupyin' all of my thoughts
Turned my soul upside down with lessons you taught
I could feel you
Even when you're far away you're right here wit' me
Sweet love strictly
And I'mma bend over backwards to keep you on my side
Take you for a mental and emotional ride
Make love to your soul,
Your heart, and your mind
In your hour of need, girl,
I'll be there every time
And as long as you support my dreams
Stayin' right beside me as a part of my team
I'mma take you where the average man can only dream of
'Cause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love


You will always be my candy
(You'll)
One day we will start a family
You will always be my candy girl
(My candy girl, Candy girl)
(You'll be my candy girl forever)
You will always be my candy
(You'll will always)
Want your love girl understand me
(True love, hey, hey)
You will always be my candy girl
{I love you too}
(I'm down for whatever)


Candy girl
You are my world
(Candy, candy)
Look so sweet
You're a special treat
(You'll be my candy girl forever)


Candy girl
All I want to say
(Word is bond, sweetheart, I swear)
I need your love
(I'm down for whatever)


Candy girl
(I love you Baby, I love you Baby)
(Sometimes you gotta go back home)
Look so sweet
(Yeah)
{I love you}
Candy girl
