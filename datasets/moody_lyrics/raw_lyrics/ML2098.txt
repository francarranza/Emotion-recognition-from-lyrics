Beyond you there's a forever
Beyond you there's a sun
Beyond you there's no never
Beyond you there's someone

After this it will be spring
After this there will be dusk
After this birds will sing
After this there will be love

Beyond you I will see clearly
Beyond you my heart will soar
Beyond you I will love dearly
That's what I am praying for
That's what I am praying for

Beyond you I will see clearly
Beyond you my heart will soar
Beyond you I will love dearly
That's what I am praying for
That's what I am praying for

That's what I am praying for
That's what I am praying for
