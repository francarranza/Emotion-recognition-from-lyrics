All things bright and beautiful you are
All things wise and wonderful you are
In my darkest night
You brightened up the skies
A song will rise, I will

Sing a song of hope, sing along
God of Heaven come down, Heaven come down
Just to know that you are near is enough
God of Heaven come down, Heaven come down, yeah

All things new, I can start again
Creator God, calling me your friend
Sing praise my soul, to the maker of the skies
A song will rise, I will

Sing a song of hope, sing along
God of Heaven come down, Heaven come down
Just to know that you are near is enough
God of Heaven come down, Heaven come down

Oh sing a song of hope, sing along
God of Heaven come down, Heaven come down
Just to know you and be loved is enough
God of Heaven come down, Heaven come down

(Hallelujah, sing)
(Hallelujah, sing)
(Sing, oh Hallelujah, sing)

Sing a song of hope, sing along
God of Heaven come down, Heaven come down
Just to know that you are near is enough
God of Heaven come down, Heaven come down

Oh sing a song of hope, sing along
God of Heaven come down, Heaven come down
Just to know that you are near is enough
God of Heaven come down, Heaven come down

Oh sing a song of hope, sing along
God of Heaven come down, Heaven come down
Just to know you and be loved is enough
God of Heaven come down, Heaven come down, yeah

(Heaven come down)
(Heaven come down)
(Heaven come down)
(Heaven come down)
