Hey baby, love to you

And I can tell by the way you swish and walk
I can tell by the way you baby talk
And I can know by the way you treat your girl
I can give you all the lovin' in the whole wide world

All I wanna do is cook your bread
Just to make sure you're well-fed
I don't want you sad and blue
And I just wanna make love to you

And I wanna love, alright
I wanna love you, baby, yeah

All I wanna do is cook your bread
Just to make sure that you're well-fed
I don't want you sad and blue
And I just wanna make love to you

(Love to you)
