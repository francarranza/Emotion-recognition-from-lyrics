Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye (repeat 8x times)
Put you to the bed, bed, bed

Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye

Girl, change into that Victoria Secret thing that I like
All right
OK, tonight you're having me your way
Perfume, spray it there
Put our love in the air
Now put me right next to you
Fittin' to raise the temp in the room
First rub my back like you do
Right there, uh-uh, right there uh
You touch me like you care
Now Stop
And let me repay you for the week that you've been through
Working that 9-5 and staying cute, like you do
Oh, oh, oh

I love it (I love it)
You love it (You love it)
Everytime (Everytime)
We touchin (We touchin)
I want it (I want it)
You want it (You want it)
I'll see you (see you)
In the morning (In the morning)

I wanna put my fingers through your hair
Wrap me up in your legs
And love you till your eyes roll back
I'm tryin' to put you to bed, bed, bed
I'mma put you to bed, bed, bed
Then I'ma rock your body
Turn you over
Love is war
I'm your soldier
Touching you like it's our first time
I'mma put you to bed, bed, bed
I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed

I'm staring at you while your sleep
Irreplaceable beauty
Put my face up in your neck and breathe (aww, breathe)
Take you into my senses
Wake up, it's time to finish
Round two, It's round two
Matter of fact it's closer to three
She like, "how long I been 'sleep?"
Shorty, kisses turn into the sweetest dreams
Like give it to me
And I can feel her tell me
My angel this is wonderful
Thanks, for letting me bless ya
Come down, fly, right, drift back into heaven
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

I love it (I love it)
You love it (You love it)
Everytime (Everytime)
We touchin (We touchin)
I want it (I want it)
You want it (You want it)
I'll see you (see you)
In the morning (In the morning)

I wanna put my fingers through your hair
Wrap me up in your legs
And love you till your eyes roll back
I'm tryin' to put you to bed, bed, bed
I'mma put you to bed, bed, bed
Then I'ma rock your body
Turn you over
Love is war
I'm your soldier
Touching you like it's our first time
I'mma put you to bed, bed, bed
I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed

Watch the sunlight peak over the horizons
Ou-Ou, Ou-Ou, Ou-Ou, Ou-Ou
Sun ain't the only thing that's shining
Ou-Ou, Ou-Ou, Ou-Ou, Ou-Ou
Now, I'mma send you out into the world with my love
Tell everybody aye, aye, aye [x10]

I wanna put my fingers through your hair
Wrap me up in your legs
And love you till your eyes roll back
I'm tryin' to put you to bed, bed, bed
I'mma put you to bed, bed, bed
Then I'ma rock your body
