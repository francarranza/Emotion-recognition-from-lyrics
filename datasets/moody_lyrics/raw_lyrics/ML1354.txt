As we stroll along together
Holding hands, walking all alone
So in love are we two, that we don't know what to do 
So in love  in a world all our own 

As we stroll by the sea together 
Under stars twinkling high above 
So in love are we two, no one else but me and you 
So in love , so much in love 
So in love , so much in love 

We stroll along together 
I tell you I need you oh so much 
I love, love you my darling 
Can you tell it in my touch? 

When we walk down the aisle together
We will vow to be together till we die
So much love have we two, just can't wait to say "I do"
So in love  are you and I  
So in love  are you and I 
So in love  are you and I
