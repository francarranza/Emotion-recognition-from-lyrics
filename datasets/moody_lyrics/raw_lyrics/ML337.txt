Excuse me, miss, can I have
Just one dance with you?
Must admit I was hooked
The moment I saw you

Candle light atmosphere
Music in the air
Your perfume fills the room
I'm lovin' the clothes you wear

Double-dare you to take
Take a chance tonight
Don't resist, I can feel
That the time is right

So strong
So strong
Your love is so strong
Baby, so strong

Your love is so strong
So strong
Your groove is so strong
Baby, so strong

Tell me this, like to know
Is there someone else?
Did you come with your girls
Or are you by yourself?

If you'd like to be friends
I'd like to take you out
Maybe then we can see
What this is all about

So strong
So strong
Your love is so strong
Baby, so strong

Your love is so strong
So strong
Your groove is so strong
Baby, so strong

So strong
So strong
Your love is so strong
Baby, so strong

Your love is so strong
So strong
Your groove is so strong
Baby, so strong

So strong
So strong
Your love is so strong
Baby, so strong

Your love is so strong
So strong
Your groove is so strong
Baby, so strong

So strong
So strong
Your love is so strong
Baby, so strong

Your love is so strong
So strong
Your groove is so strong
Baby, so strong

Girl, I'm feeling like
Like I'm paradise
I'm feeling so
