Happy, happy, birthday baby
Although you're with somebody new
Thought I'd drop a line to say
That I wish this happy day
Would find me beside you.

Happy, happy, birthday baby
No, I can't call you my baby
Seems like years ago we met
On a day I can't forget.

'Cause that's when we fell in love
Do you remember the names we had for each other
You were my pretty, I was your baby
How could we say goodbye?

Hope I didn't spoil your birthday
I know I'm acting kinda crazy
So I'll close this note to you
With good luck and wishes too.

Happy, happy birthday baby
Do you remember the names we had for each other
You were my pretty... I was your baby
How could we say goodbye?

Hope I didn't spoil your birthday
I know I'm acting kinda crazy
So, I'll close this note to you
With good luck and wishes too.

Happy, happy, birthday baby...
