Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of goal
Some kind of majesty
Some Chemical load

Some kind of metal made up from glue
Some kind of plastic I could wrap around you
The needy eat man mades, they wear
Phony clothes
They sit with barbiturates until they
Grow old

Some kind of nature some kind of soul
Some kind of mixtures
Some Kind of goal
Some kind of majesty some
Chemical load

While me, I love plastics and
Digital foils
To wrap up the sound and
Protect the girls
From the spiritual poison we expel
At night
Like phony clothes, but I really
Like might

Some kind of nature (Some kind of
Nature, some kind of soul)
Come forth within us
Oh Lord forgive me
(Some kind of mixture, some
Kind of goal)
It's gonna come and find us
All we are is stars

Some kind of metal made up from glue
Some kind of plastic I could wrap around you
The needy eat man mades, they wear
Phony clothes
They sit with barbiturates until they
Grow old

Some kind of nature (Some kind of
Nature, some kind of soul)
Come forth within us
Oh Lord forgive me
(Some kind of mixture, some
Kind of goal)
It's gonna come and find us
All we are is stars
