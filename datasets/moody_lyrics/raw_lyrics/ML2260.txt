Shadows of doubt consume you
The light you barely see
Growing wings of sorrow,
Have brought you to the winds of plague
Increscent boundaries fade the way
A barren future all too real
And still I try to seek up and find the flame
And still I try... inside
It's Endless
A barren future all too real
And still I try
Endless Fight
Endless Tragedy
Endless Lunacy
Chalk up the past as a memory
This battering sickness has surely won
All I have I have wasted
Will this erase me
Time to clean my wounds
Can I win this battle inside and out
Can I win this battle inside-out
Endless Fight
Endless Tragedy
Endless Lunacy
