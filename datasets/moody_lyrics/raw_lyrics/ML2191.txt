Even though it's not my birthday
I'm gon' party like it's my birthday
We gon' party like it's my birthday
It's my birthday, it's my birthday

So fling up your hands in the air
It's my birthday
Drop it like you don't care
We gonna party

Fling up your hands in the air
We gonna celebrate
Like it's my birthday, it's my birthday

It's my day
Nobody's gonna get in my way
Give me some of that Grand Marnier
Me and that fly mamacita sippin' tequila

Down in MIA
We don't really care 'bout what them say
Listen to the music
That the DJ, that the DJ, that the DJ, DJ, DJ play

Bartender give me a shot of that Hennessy
Patron for the girls them next to me
Gimme Redbull for the energy
The energy

Even though it's not my birthday
I'm gon' party like it's my birthday
We gon' party like it's my birthday
It's my birthday, it's my birthday

So fling up your hands in the air
It's my birthday
Drop it like you don't care
We gonna party

Fling up your hands in the air
We gonna celebrate
Like it's my birthday, it's my birthday

People jumping in the party
And we feeling high like Bob Marley
D-D-D-DJ run the party
And we need more drinks 'cause were not tipsy

Girls them looking at the G O D
Fresh in my clothes, all eyes on me
Pop champagne, make the world see me
Listen to the bass and the melody

Music pumping in the beat of my heart
Just dance
And I want to see you move it
Get in the groove and move it
And me tell the whole of them say

Music pumping in the beat of my heart
Just dance
And I want to see you move it
Get in the groove and move it
Just move it

Even though it's not my birthday
I'm gon' party like it's my birthday
We gon' party like it's my birthday
It's my birthday, it's my birthday

So fling up your hands in the air
It's my birthday
Drop it like you don't care
We gonna party

Fling up your hands in the air
We gonna celebrate
Like it's my birthday, it's my birthday

Music pumping in the beat of my heart
Just dance
And I want to see you move it
Get in the groove and move it
And me tell the whole of them say

Music pumping in the beat of my heart
Just dance
And I want to see you move it
Get in the groove and move it
Just move it
