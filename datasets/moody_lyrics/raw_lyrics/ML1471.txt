The problem of leisure
What to do for pleasure
Ideal love, a new purchase
A market of the senses

Dream of the perfect life
Economic circumstances
The body is good business
Sell out, maintain the interest

Remember Lot's wife
Renounce all sin and vice
Dream of the perfect life
This heaven gives me migraine

The problem of leisure
What to do for pleasure

Coercion of the senses
We are not so gullible
Our great expectations
A future for the good

Fornication makes you happy
No escape from society
Natural is not in it
Your relations are of power

We all have good intentions
But all with strings attached

Repackaged sex keeps your interest
Repackaged sex keeps your interest
Repackaged sex keeps your interest
Repackaged sex keeps your interest
Repackaged sex keeps your interest
Repackaged sex keeps your interest

The problem of leisure
What to do for pleasure
Ideal love, a new purchase
A market of the senses

Dream of the perfect life
Economic circumstances
The body is good business
Sell out, maintain the interest

Remember Lot's wife
Renounce all sin and vice
Dream of the perfect life
This heaven gives me migraine

This heaven gives me migraine
This heaven gives me migraine
