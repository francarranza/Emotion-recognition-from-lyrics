Oh, yeah ladies, oh ladies
This one's for you, hey

Imma love you right, Imma love you right
Imma love you right, Imma love you right
Imma love you right
Yeah, yeah

Imma love you with my eyes, baby
So I can see you in my life
Love you with my hands
So I can touch your body right

Love you with my voice, baby
So I can sing sweet melodies
Love you with my time
And it will be just you and me

Ain't nothin' wrong with loving you with everything I have
And a little more to keep you cool
Ain't nothin' wrong with giving you the keys to the Range
And the house with a indoor pool

And ain't nothin' wrong
With a little bit of bump and grind
Ain't nothin' wrong with giving
My heart, my soul, my mind, my mind

Imma love you right, Imma love you right
Imma love you right, Imma love you right
Imma love you right
Yeah, yeah

Imma love you with my life, baby
'Cause every breath I breathe for you
Tell you no lies, lady
'Cause everything I say is true

Imma love you with my mind, baby
'Cause I think you are the one
And if you feelin' different
Just remember you're my girl

Ain't nothin' wrong with loving you with everything I have
And a little more to keep you cool
Ain't nothin' wrong with giving you the keys to the Range
And the house with a indoor pool

And ain't nothin' wrong
With a little bit of bump and grind
So if you feelin' different
Just remember that you're mine

I know this a little bit much for this first conversation
But this Patron I'm sippin' got me feelin' impatient
Let's go half on the baby, make love crazy
It's gonna feel so right

So let's get out of this club
So we can make love all night

Imma love you right, Imma love you right
Imma love you right, Imma love you right
(Imma love you right, any way that you want me to)
Imma love you right

Imma love you right, Imma love you right
(Baby, you ain't never had nobody like me)
Imma love you right, Imma love you right
(Anything you could want)
Imma love you right
(I'm gonna love you)
