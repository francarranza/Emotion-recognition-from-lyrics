You've been out of my life for some time now
Seems like a long long while
Sometimes thoughts of you
Bring tears to my eyes
Other times they bring a smile
I remember what you told me
We would always be close in our hearts
Must be easy to say
In another man's arms
And we're so damn far apart but

On a real lonely night
I can almost hear you laughing
It's making me a fool
And I can almost see your face
On a real lonely night

There's a picture of you
Hanging on my wall
Such a lovely girl
Sometimes I feel like breaking it to pieces
Like you did to my world
And other times I want to hold it in my arms
Like a ball and chain
I know 'til I'm through
Loving you
I can never love again but

On a real lonely night
I can almost hear you laughing
It's making me a fool
On a real lonely night
There's just no way to pass the time
I walk around and talk to myself
Pretending that it's you
And I can almost see your face

I can't hold you
Like I used to do

On a real lonely night
I can almost hear you laughing
And feel your warm breath
Upon my skin
It's making me a fool
On a real lonely night
There's just no way to pass the time
I walk around and talk to myself
Pretending that it's you and
I can almost see your face
I can almost see your face
On a real lonely night
On a real lonely night
On a real lonely night
I can almost hear you laughing
