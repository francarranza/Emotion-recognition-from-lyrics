In the depths of the deep blue sea
There's a blue as blue as me
Where a quiet symphony plays for the lonely

I could just let it all go
Sink down to the world below
Where I don't breathe but I don't know
'Cause I'm breathless

When it's love
It will rain sometimes
When it's love, it will pour
Pour

I don't where my lover went
But I know that he took the rent
And I know that he went and spent all my loving

And I'm not rich, but I don't care
I'll find that boy anywhere
I'll walk the land, fly the air, and tread water

When it's love
It will rain sometimes
When it's love, it will pour
Pour

If the moon could sing a song
With the symphony in the blue beyond
They'd tell me he was really gone forever

When it's love
It will rain sometimes
When it's love, it will pour

When it's love
It will rain sometimes
When it's love, it will pour
Pour, pour, pour

It will pour
It will pour
It will pour
