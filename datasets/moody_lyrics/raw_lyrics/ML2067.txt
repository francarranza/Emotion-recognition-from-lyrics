But I can still hear it beating
So if you flash your heart

I promise (I promise, I promise)

Our love was lost
In the rubble of all the things
You, you've been dreaming of
Keep me in mind
When you're ready
I am here
To take you every time

Our love was lost
Lost, lost, lost, lost
Lost, lost, lost
Our love was lost
But now it's found
