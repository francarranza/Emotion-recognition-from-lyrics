Close your eyes, clear your mind
And you'll find you're free
Close your eyes, clear your mind
Come on trust in me

You're riding down the highway
You ain't got no highway shoes
But if you're born with nothing child
How can you ever, ever lose

Close your eyes, clear your mind
And you'll find you're free
Close your eyes, clear your mind
Come on trust in me

Don'tcha know, can'tcha see, you'll be free - It's all right
Don'tcha know, can'tcha see, trust in me - It's all right
Don'tcha know, can'tcha see, you'll be free - It's all right
Let it go, then you'll know, you can see
You'll be free - you'll be free - you'll be free

Close your eyes, clear your mind
And you'll find you're free
Close your eyes, clear your mind
Come on trust in me

Close your eyes, clear your mind
And you'll find you're free
Close your eyes, clear your mind
Baby, come on trust in me

This goodbye to the things you thought you had
You won't care when you realize
That life's just a dream, life is a dream that's true

Close your eyes, clear your mind
And you'll find you're free
Close your eyes, clear your mind
Come on trust in me
