(Kill me with a/the beat)

Some people seem to think they always know what's best for you
Their little minds try to create a world to keep you still
The bolt is strong, the cage is locked, you saw this, don't you lie
At first you cry and then you hate those people, stole your will

Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
'Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario
(No nothing)

Do you call my name
Do you stain my brain
My eyes are blurry and I can't see you anymore
Do you call my name
Do you breed my pain
My heart is bloody and I can't take it anymore

So you just sit there stuck, afraid to risk reality
Afraid to cause yourself more pain to face insanity
But nothing ventured, nothing gained, you see your fear's your cage
You beg for help but you're alone stuck in a helpless rage

Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
'Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario

It's me...
I see...
Please...
(Let me out, I'm petrified)

Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
'Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario

(C'mon)

(x2)
Do you call my name
Do you stain my brain
My eyes are blurry and I can't see you anymore
Do you call my name
Do you breed my pain
My heart is bloody and I can't take it anymore
