Hey baby, you're driving me crazy
With that special loving feeling that you give to me
And I'm so proud you want me to be your lady
Now I know how it feels to live a fantasy

I used to dream about love
And sure that's how it was
But I don't have to dream no more
'Cause I got more than I can stand
I found me a lover in another man
I got you baby that's all I was waiting for

And I love the way you love me
I place no one above
Of the way that you love
I love (and I love) the way you love me
And baby no matter what
I love the, I love the way you love

Oh, baby baby baby, I might as well face it
I've fallen in so deep you have control of me
Without a doubt it has to be the greatest
You're every bit the man I had hoped you'd be

I used to dream about love
And sure that's how it was
But I don't have to dream no more, oh no
'Cause when I think about your loving then I get a good beat
I get excited from the feeling that it's giving to me
So won't you keep it coming baby 'cause I love the joy you bring

And I love the way you love me
I love it, love it, love it
I place no one above
Of the way that you love
And I love the way you love me
And baby no matter what
I love the, I love the way you love

I love the way you love
I got a love so don't you stop
I love the way

One for all the special love
Two a sensitive and tender touch
Three because you please you bring out the best in me
'Cause when I think about your loving then I get a good beat
I get excited from the feeling that it's giving to me
So won't you keep it coming baby 'cause I love the joy you bring
I, I, I, I love

I love the way you love
I love the way

And I love the way you love me
I love it, love it, love it
I place no one above
Other than you love
And I love the way you love me
And baby no matter what
I love the, I love the way you love

Oh baby, keep it coming
Oh baby, keep it coming
Oh baby, keep it coming

One, for all the special love
Two, a sensitive and tender touch
Three, because you please
You bring out the best in me
'Cause when I think about your loving then I get a good beat
I get excited from the feeling that it's giving to me, it's so sweet
So won't you keep it coming baby 'cause I love the joy you bring

I, I, I, I love the way you love me
I place no one above
I don't want true love
And I love the way you love me
And baby no matter what
I love the
I love the way you love

You got me all over
You got me all over
I love the way you love
Love you all over
Love you all over
I love the way

And I love the way you love me, I love it
I place no one above
I don't want you love
And I love
