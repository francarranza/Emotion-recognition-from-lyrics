The truly unforgiven will never let this die
So scream your heart out to reject one more time

This tragic need for hope
Won't give up
It's what keeps us alive
Now who will survive
In this game of chance
Now hold out your hand
And give me this final dance

If I load this gun, would you hold in your heart and give your life for love?
So bleed this hate with me
And fight these broken dreams

This is more than hopeless romantics
I will never let it die
I walk the line
And your daybreak eyes
The whispers
And the blacked out skies

The blacked out skies!

The truly unforgiven will never let this die
We scream our hearts out to reject one more time

If I load this gun, could you hold it to your heart and give your life for love?
So bleed this hate with me
And fight these broken dreams

So bleed
This hate
And fight these broken dreams

I will fight these broken dreams
