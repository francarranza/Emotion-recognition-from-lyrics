You are my peace
You are my peace
You are my peace
And I worship thee
(Repeat)
You have delivered my soul
When the battle was against me
And Your promises You kept
That Your Word will set me free
(If I just) keep my mind on thee
You'll keep me in perfect peace
You have delivered my soul
(From the snare of the enemy)
In the midst of my storm

You held and protected me
(If I just) keep my mind on thee
You'll keep me in perfect peace
You have delivered my soul
(From the snare of the enemy)
In the midst of my storm
You held and protected me
(If I just) keep my mind on thee
You'll keep me in perfect peace

Vamp:
Peace
My Peace
Peace
You're My Peace
