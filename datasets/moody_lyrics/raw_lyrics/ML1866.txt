She shines with her own kind of light
She look at you once in a day
That's all wrong looks all right
And I love her
God knows I love her

Kentucky Woman
If she get to know you
She goin' to own you

Well, she ain't the kind
Make heads turn at the drop of her name
But something inside
That she's got turns you on just the same
And She loves me
God knows She loves me

The good Lord's earth beneath my feet
A gentle touch
From that one girl and life is
Sweet and good
There ain't no doubt
I'm talking about
