There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly led me to you
Look at the sky
It's the colour of love

There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly came down from above
He led me to you
He led me to you

He built a bridge to your heart
All the way
How many tons of love inside
I can't say

When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
I swear the whole world could feel my heartbeat
When I lay eyes on you
Ay ay ay
You wrapped me up in
The colour of love

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like
The kiss of life

Wasn't it clear from the start
Look
The sky is full of love
Yeah
The sky is full of love

He built a bridge to your heart
All the way
How many tons of love inside
I can't say

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like
The kiss of life

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like
The kiss of life

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like
The kiss of life

You wrapped me up in
The colour of love
Must have been an angel
Came down from above
Giving me love, yeah
Giving me love, yeah

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like
The kiss of life
