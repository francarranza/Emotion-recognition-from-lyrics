You've got your ball
You've got your chain
Tied to me tight, tie me up again
Who's got their claws
In you my friend?
Into your heart I'll beat again

Sweet like candy to my soul
Sweet you rock and sweet you roll
Lost for you, I'm so lost for you
Oh when you come crash
Into me and I come into you
And I come into you
In a boy's dream
In a boy's dream

Touch your lips just so I know
In your eyes, love, it glows so
I'm bare-boned and crazy
For you
Oh when you come crash
Into me, baby
And I come into you
In a boy's dream
In a boy's dream

And if I've gone overboard
Then I'm begging you to forgive me
In my haste, when I'm holding you so girl
Close to me
When you come crash
Into me, baby
And I come into you

Hike up your skirt a little more
And show the world to me
Hike up your skirt a little more
And show your world to me
In a boy's dream
In a boy's dream

Oh I watch you there through the window
And I stare at you
You wear nothing but you wear it so well
Tied up and twisted, the way I'd like to be
For you, for me, come crash into me baby
Come crash into me, yeah

Crash into me
Crash into me
Crash into me

I'm the king of the castle, you're the dirty rascal
Crash into me, please crash into me baby

Oh, yes, I see the waves come and crash into me
I see the waves come and crash into me
Crash into me
