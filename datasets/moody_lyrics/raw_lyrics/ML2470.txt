You spurn my natural emotions
You make me feel I'm dirt and I'm hurt
And if I start a commotion
I run the risk of losing you and that's worse

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone you shouldn't've fallen in love with?

I can't see much of a future
Unless we find out what's to blame, what a shame
And we won't be together much longer
Unless we realize that we are the same

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone you shouldn't've fallen in love with?

You disturb my natural emotions
You make me feel I'm dirt and I'm hurt
And if I start a commotion
I'll only end up losing you and that's worse

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with?

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone you shouldn't've fallen in love with?

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone you shouldn't've fallen in love with?
Fallen in love with
Ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't've fallen in love with
