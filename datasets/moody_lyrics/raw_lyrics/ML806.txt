Honey, you're so fine
I wanna be with you all of the time
I couldn't tell you just how much I loved you
But now that you're all mine, I'll tell you all the time

Honey, you're so sweet
I wanna be with you every week
I couldn't tell you just how much I loved you
But now that you're all mine, I'll tell you all the time

Honey
Honey
Honey
Honey

You're so good to me when you go away
But when you get home you don't have much to say
It doesn't matter to me the way 
All I want is for you to stay

Honey
