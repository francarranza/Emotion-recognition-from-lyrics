My love is your love
Every night and every day
My love is your love
Every night and every day
Well, it keeps me so happy
When you love me up this way

When I come home drunk
And I won't let you get your rest
When I come home drunk
And I won't let you get your rest
It's because, pretty baby
You're the one I love the best

Love me, sweet heart, love me, dear
Whisper words, I don't hear
My love is your love
Every night and every day
But it makes me so happy
When you love me up this way

Love me, sweet heart, love me, dear
Whisper words that I don't hear
My love is your love
Every night and every day
Well, it keeps me so happy
When you love me up this way

Oh, love me up this way
When you love this way
Keep me so happy
When you love this way
When you love me up this way
When you love this way

Gonna make me happy, baby
When you love this way
Oh, when you keep me so happy
When you love this way
You love this way
When you love
