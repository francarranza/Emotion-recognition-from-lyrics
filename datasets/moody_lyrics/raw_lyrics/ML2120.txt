Yeah, yeah, I went walking
On the avenue
Listen to the riders who may
Yeah, listen to you

And my footsteps tangle
With perfume
And the sound of lovemaking
Coming out of some room
And the indians sing

How far am I from Canaan?
How far am I from joy, from joy?
How far am I from Canaan?
How far am I from joy, from joy?

There's a woman leaning on the corner
She waits for her gambler
Yeah, dressing babies up in cotton
On the front seat of her rambler

Low down
While she says that she remembers
Yeah, of a prayer
That mama used to sing
Yeah, and the battered wife sing

How far am I from Canaan?
How far am I from joy, from joy?
How far am I from joy, from joy?

How far am I from Canaan?
How far am I from joy, from joy?
How far am I from Canaan?
How far am I from joy, from joy?

How far am I from Canaan?
How far am I from joy, from joy?
How far am I from Canaan?
How far am I from joy, from joy?

How far am I from Canaan?
How far am I from joy, from joy, from joy?
