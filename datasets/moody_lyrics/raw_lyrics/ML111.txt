It's hard to explain
The hardships and pain
That true lovers must endure
That's for sure
I have my regrets
But much more than that
This special love we must secure
More and more

There's no better feelin'
Than when I rise up to see the morning sun
And watch the sunrise in you eyes
You're like the summer breeze
When I'm going through my winter time
So baby take this love of mine

'Cause anything you want, girl
I will give it to you
Anything you need, girl
My heart will be so true
Anything you want, girl
I will give it to you
Anything you need, girl
My heart will always be true to you


They say once you're bit, you're twice as shy
I have no reason to ask you why, why oh why
We must understand the ultimate plan
Is that we live a happy life
In the by and by

There's no better feelin'
Than when I rise up to see the morning sun
And watch the sunrise in you eyes
You're like the summer breeze
That comes to me in the winter time
So honey, I hope you realize

'Cause anything you want, girl
I will give it to you
Anything you need, girl
My heart will always be true
Anything you want, girl
I will surely give it to you
Anything you need, girl
My heart will always be true to you
