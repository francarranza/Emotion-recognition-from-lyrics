(Let me)

Dumb summer sun
Where have you gone
Bring me another

Dumb summer sun
Why don't you come
I'll be your lover
Sister and brother
'Cause we love it (we love it, we love it)

Skin
I love your skin
And what's within
I love you

Skin
I love your skin
And what's within
I love you

Dumb summer sun
Wait is no fun
Let's go undercover
Close to each other
'Cause we love it (we love it, we love it)

Skin
I love your skin
And what's within
I love you

Skin
I love your skin
And what's within
I love you

Skin
I love you

Skin
I love you

Skin
I love your skin
I love your skin
I love your skin
I love your skin
I love your skin
I love your skin
I love your skin
I love your skin
I love your
