I'll have a blue Christmas without you I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing dear if you're not here with me
I'll have a blue Christmas for certain
And when that blue blue heartache starts hurtin'
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas

And when those blue heartaches start hurtin'
I'll have a blue mem'ry for certain
You'll be doing alright...
You'll be doing alright...
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas
