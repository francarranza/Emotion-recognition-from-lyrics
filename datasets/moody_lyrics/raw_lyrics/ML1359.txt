I can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles
And the heavens open every time she smiles
When I come to here, that's where I belong
Yet I'm running to her like a river's song

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
Alright man

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache in the night like a thief

Give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
Give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
Ray

Yes I need her in the daytime 
Yes I need her in the night 
Yes I want to throw my arms around her 
Kiss her hug her, kiss her hug her tight

And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day
Yes it makes me feel righteous, makes me feel whole
Makes me mellow down in to my soul

Give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
Give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
Give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
Give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

Give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
Give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
Give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
Give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
