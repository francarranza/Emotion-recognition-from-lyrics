Will I ever love you again?
Will we be together again?
Thought the love we had was strong
Tell me what's on
Where did we go wrong?

Will I, Will I, Will I
Will I, Will I, Will I

Will I ever love you again?
Will we be together again?
Thought the love we had was strong
Tell me what's on
Where did we go wrong?

Will I ever love you again?
Will we be together again?
Thought the love we had was strong
Tell me what's on
Where did we go wrong?
