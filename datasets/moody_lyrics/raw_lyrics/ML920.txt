We're getting stronger everyday,
We're getting braver in every way.
Hallelujah here we come.

We're getting stronger everyday
Push through the rains that fall our way,
Hallelujah here we come

We're much stronger when we're one
Hallelujah here we come

Oh, I love You from the depths of my heart,
And nothing here will tear us apart,
Everything's beautiful with You,
Everything's beautiful, when You invade my life
And I'm living just to say that 'I love You'

We're getting closer everyday
Chasing the dreams that heaven gave,
Hallelujah here we come, yeah.

We're getting closer everyday
Into Your arms I'm here to stay,
We're much stronger when we're one
Hallelujah here we come

Oh I love You from the depths of my heart,
And nothing here will tear us apart,
Everything's beautiful with You,
Everything's beautiful when You invade my life
And I'm living just to say that 'I love You'

Yes, I love You
Oh I love You now
Oh I love You now
Oh I love You now
Oh I love You now
Oh I love You now
Oh I love You now
Oh I love You now
Oh I love You
I love You, Lord
Yes, I love You
