I love King Selassie
I love King Selassie I
I love King Selassie
I love King Selassie I

I love King Selassie red
I love King Selassie I gold
I love King Selassie green
Oh, I love everything that is clean

I love King Selassie
I love King Selassie I
I love King Selassie
I love King Selassie I

He's the only man in flesh
Whom you can't look in the eyes
From the first time I know JAH JAH
He is so divine   
He is called as a Lamb 
The only man that's on this land 
Some people feel that they can work Jah to the bone

I love King Selassie
I love King Selassie I
I love King Selassie
I love King Selassie I

So they can rule the trone

Useless praying to the spirit
'Cause the spirit is within the flesh of I and I
So there goes an illusion
The spirit is an illusion

I love King Selassie
I love King Selassie I
I love King Selassie
I love King Selassie I
