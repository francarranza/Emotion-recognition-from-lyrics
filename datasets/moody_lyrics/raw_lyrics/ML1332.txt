Baby black sky
Black sky is all I see
Yeah baby black sky
Black sky is all I see
Please stand beside me baby
Shine your light for me

Well I been all around the world
Ain't nothin' I ain't seen
From the Mekong River to the
San Joaquin
I made it down to Helena
But it's just a ghost town
And I got to Jackson
But they tore old Jackson down

Yeah I been around the world
Black sky is all I see
Why don't you stand beside me baby
Shine your light for me

Baby well I went to the graveyard
To see my friend one last time
People gathered 'round
Some were prayin', some were cryin'
They were talkin' about heaven
And the final judgement day
But all I could do was say goodbye to him
Turn and walk away

Yeah I went to the graveyard
But black sky was all I seen
Please stand beside me baby
Shine your light for me

I wake up every mornin'
Try the best I can
To make it one more day
In a world I don't understand
Now the sun baby's shinin'
But there's darkness on the land
And I can't find my way baby
Unless you take my hand

Yeah I, I wake up every mornin' baby
Black sky is all I see
Please stand beside me baby
Shine your light for me

Yeah black sky
Black sky is all I see
Please shine your light pretty baby
Take this black sky away from me
