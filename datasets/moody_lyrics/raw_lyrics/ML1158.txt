Uh, uh, oh
Oh, yeah
Uh, uh, oh

Girl, it feels like heaven
When I make love to you
There's no space or loophole for
No one to get to you

'Cause I'm so much in love
(So much)
So much in love
(So much)
I'm fallin' in love with you

Because I'm so much in love
(So much)
So much in love
(So much)
I'm so much in love with you

Baby, you're the one
That make me strong
And together we long
We keep holdin' on and on

And if there's something, baby
You would love to try
All we've got to do is love
The love could show us

Because I'm so much in love
(So much)
So much in love
(So much)
I'm fallin' in love with you

Because I'm so much in love
(So much)
So much in love
(So much)
I'm so much in love with you

You're my everyday and every time
You're the one that's by my side
Never let me go and that's a no, no
I'll love you till I die

Our love us forever
There's nothing to measure
Baby, want to love you
There isn't no lie

'Cause I'm so much in love
(So much)
So deep in love
(So much)
And I don't wanna do no one but you

'Cause I'm so much in love
(So much)
So much in love
(So much)
I'm so much in love with you

Girl, it feels like heaven
When I make love to you
There's no space or loophole for
No one to get to you

Because I'm so much in love
(So much)
So much in love
(So much)
I'm fallin' in love with you

Because I'm so much in love
(So much)
I'm so much in love
(So much)
I'm so much in love with you

So much in love
I'm so much in love with you
