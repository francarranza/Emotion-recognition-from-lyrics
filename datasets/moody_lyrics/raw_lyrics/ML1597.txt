Why can't we go away, just speeding out?
You just don't want to stay where you aim
You can't depend and stay all night
You can't often stay all night
Better say no more, woh, woh, woh, woh, let me free no more
Why can't we wait, stay where you haze?
You feel the storm, stay where you haze
You're waiting then to start on out
We can't depend where we stay where you mind
Better say no more, woh, woh, woh, woh, let me free no more

Why can't we go or stay where you mind?
You can depend when you stay where you mind
Well, then you go and stray away
You just don't want to stay where you mind
Better say no more, woh, woh, woh, woh, let me free no more

Let me free no more, let me free no more
Let me free no more, let me free no more
Let me free no more, let me free no more
Let me free no more, let me free no more
Let me free no more, let me free no more
Let me free no more, let me free no more
Let me free no more, let me free no more
