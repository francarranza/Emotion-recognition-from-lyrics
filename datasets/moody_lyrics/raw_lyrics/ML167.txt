All I've ever wanted was destiny to be fulfilled
It is in my hands, I must not fail, I must not fail

Even through the darkest days
This fire burns always
This fire burns always

This is the broken ground as the heat begins to rise
Turn away from yesterday; tomorrow's in my eyes, oh



Even through the darkest days
This fire burns always
This fire burns always

I will not be denied in this final hour
I will not be denied, this day is mine
This passion inside me is burning, is burning
This passion inside me is burning, is burning

Even through the darkest days
This fire burns always 
This fire burns 
Always, always
