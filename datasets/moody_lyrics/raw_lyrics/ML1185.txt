If you told me that you loved me I would feel so proud
Let me hold you honey, I'd holler out loud
Never love another even if I can
Come to me baby I'm a one woman man

Now won't you love me baby just to kinda hang around
I'll always love you honey, I'll never let you down
Never love another even if I can
Come to me baby I'm a one woman man

Well I'd climb the highest mountain if it reached the sky
To prove that I love you I'd jump off and fly
I'd even swim the ocean from shore to shore
To prove that I love you just a little bit more

Ah won't you love me baby just to kinda hang around
I'll always love you honey, I'll never let you down
Never love another even if I can
Come to me baby I'm a one woman man

Now won't you love me baby just to kinda hang around
I'll always love you honey, I'll never let you down
Never love another even if I can
Come to me baby I'm a one woman man

Come to me baby I'm a one woman man
Come to me baby I'm a one woman man
