I turn the other way
I'll never turn you down
You turn me on
Don't speak out every meaning
I don't belong to you
You don't belong to me
So don't hold on too tightly...

Let me know when you're lonely babe 
Let me know when you're lonely babe 

Happier now than I've been in the past 
Gone are the days 
Gone are the tears 
That was a girl I used to be 

The girl that you now see standing in front of you 
Could keep going on 
Because she believes 
In setting you free

So let me know when you're lonely babe 
Let me know when you're lonely baby 
Let me know when you're lonely babe 
Let me know when you're lonely baby 

I turn the other way 
I can never turn you down 
You turn me on 
Don't speak out every meaning

I don't belong to you 
Like you don't belong to me 
So don't hold on too tightly 
Let forever be 

So let me know when you're lonely babe 
Let me know when you're lonely baby 
Let me know when you're lonely babe 
Let me know when you're lonely baby 

Let me know when you're lonely babe (it might be sweet)
Let me know when you're lonely baby (if we could meet)
Let me know when you're lonely babe (along the way)
Let me know when you're lonely baby (that could be okay)

They're all the same in this cynical age
I won't be
Your ball and chain 
I risk my reputation 
Just to get a room
You always have the reservation 
So come lie down beside me (so let me know when you're lonely babe)
(Let me know when you're lonely baby) Beside me 
(Let me know when you're lonely babe) Beside me 
(Let me know when you're lonely baby) Beside me

So let me know when you're lonely babe (it might be sweet)
Let me know when you're lonely baby (if we could meet)
Let me know when you're lonely babe (along the way)
Let me know when you're lonely baby (that could be okay)

That could be okay

It might be sweet
If we could meet
Along the way
That could be okay
