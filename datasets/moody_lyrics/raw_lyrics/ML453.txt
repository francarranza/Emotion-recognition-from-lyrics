I love to love you baby...

When you're laying so close to me
There's no place I'd rather you be
Than with me here

I love to love you baby...

Do it to me again and again
You put me in such an awful spin
In a spin

I love to love you baby...

Lay your head down real close to me
Soothe my mind and set me free
Set me free

I love to love you baby...

When you're laying so close to me
There's no place I'd rather you be
Than with me here

I love to love you baby...

Do it to me again and again
You put me in such an awful spin
In a spin

I love to love you baby...

I love to love you baby...

I love to love you baby...

Love to love you baby baby...

I love to love you baby...

When you're laying so close to me
There's no place I'd rather you be
Than with me here

I love to love you baby...

Do it to me again and again
You put me in such an awful spin
In a spin

I love to love you baby

Lay your head down so close to
Soothe my mind and set me free
Set me free

I love to love you baby

When you're laying so close to me
There's no place I'd rather you be
Than with me here

I love to love you baby
