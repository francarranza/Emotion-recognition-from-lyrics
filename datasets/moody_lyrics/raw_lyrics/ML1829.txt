Underneath the darkened sky,
Drifting through a sea of lies
Pulled into the under tow
My body dragged deep below
...
Give me strength to push on through
Give me strength!
Seeking shelter from the storm

"Carry me when I can't go on,
Uplift my spirit
So I carry on
Was once lost
But now I'm found,
Darkness pass away into the light of dawn,
Push on through
Fight for life!"
Fight for life!"

My word
Is not with fear
But with the spirit
In unrest
I fear no man
I fear not death

I fear no man
I will prevail

Give me strength to carry on
Push on through the light of dawn

"Carry me when I can't go on,
Uplift my spirit
So I carry on
Was once lost
But now I'm found,
Darkness pass away into the light of dawn,
Push on through

Fight for life!"
Fight for life!"
Push on through
Fight for life!"
Push on through
Fight for life!"
Push on through
