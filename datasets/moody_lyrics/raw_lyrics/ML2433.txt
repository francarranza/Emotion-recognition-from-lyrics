Never alone
I don't have to worry cause, I'm never alone
Never alone, I don't have to worry cause, I'm never alone
Never alone ooh!
V1. he walks besides me, all the way
He guides my foot steps everyday (back to chorus)
V2he walks besides me all the way,
He guides my foot steps everyday
Never again will I be insecure anymore, never again
Never again, will I be insecure anymore, never again

Vamp: never! (repeat as directed)
He walks beside me, all the way, he guides my foot steps everyday

Never alone
I don't have to worry 'cause I'm never alone
