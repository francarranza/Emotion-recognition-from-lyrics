I'm so sick of me, being sick of you,
And the way you look, all the things you do,
You drive me crazy, drive me crazy
Sick of being broke, can't pay the rent
I'm about to snap, I can't handle this
I'm doing crazy, doing crazy (going crazy)

If you're sick like me
There's no stopping now,
Try to break it up
And just let it out
If I was sick like you,
I would feed the fire
I would light it up
And watch it all drop down

I'm so sick of my life
It's the same old trip,
Try to make it bend,
But it never gives
Look what you made me (what you made me)
Well I hate my boss,
He's a little bitch
If he keeps it up,
I'll make him quit
Or I'll go crazy
I'm going crazy

If you're sick like me
There's no stopping now,

Try to break it up
And just let it out
If I was sick like you,
I would feed the fire
I would light it up
And watch it all drop down
(And watch it all drop down)

I'm so sick of me, being sick of you,
And the way you look, all the things you do,
You drive me crazy, drive me crazy
Yeah!

If you're sick like me
There's no stopping now,
Try to break it up
And just let it out
If I was sick like you,
I would feed the fire
I would light it up
And watch it all drop down

(If you're sick like me,
There's no stopping now
There's no stopping now
Watch it all drop down
If you're sick like me
Then you're sick like me)
