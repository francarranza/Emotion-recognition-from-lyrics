She hangs her head and cries on my shirt
She must be hurt very badly.
Tell me what's making you sad, Li?
Open your door, don't hide in the dark.
You're lost in the dark, you can trust me,
'Cause you know that's how it must be.
Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.

Her eyes like windows trickle in rain
Upon the pain getting deeper
Though my love wants to relieve her.
She walks alone from wall to wall,
Lost in her hall she can't hear me,
Though I know she likes to be near me.
Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.

She sits in her corner by the door.
There must be more I can tell her
If she really wants me to help her.
I'll do what I can to show her the way
And maybe one day I will free her
Though I know no one can see her.
Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.
