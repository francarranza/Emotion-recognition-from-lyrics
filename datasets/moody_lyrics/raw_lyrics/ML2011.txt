Dangerous feelings
Break out my soul
It's just the meaning
Of being alone

I need you here
Wherever you are
I need you now
To take me so far

I wanna run
Like the speed of the sound
I was somewhere
I 'm sure you're around
You give me now
The meaning of life
With you I'm feeling alive

Why you're lookin' like that
I'm burning like fire
I wanna be higher

Just let me know
Why you're lookin' like that
You're driving me crazy
You're lookin' amazing

Why you're lookin' like that
I'm burning like fire
I wanna be higher

Just let me know
Why you're lookin' like that
You're driving me crazy
You're lookin' amazing

Why you're lookin' like that
I'm burning like fire
I wanna be higher

Just let me know
Why you're lookin' like that
You're driving me crazy
You're lookin' amazing

Why you're lookin' like that
I'm burning like fire
I wanna be higher

Just let me know
Why you're lookin' like that
You're driving me crazy
You're lookin' amazing
