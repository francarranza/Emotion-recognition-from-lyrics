Dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah 
Ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-wah
Only the lonely 
Only the lonely

Only the lonely 
Know the way I feel tonight 
Only the lonely 
Know this feeling ain't right 

There goes my baby
There goes my heart
They're gone forever
So far apart

But only the lonely
Know why
I cry
Only the lonely

Dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah
Ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-wah
Only the lonely
Only the lonely 

Only the lonely 
Know the heartaches I've been through 
Only the lonely 
Know I cry and cry for you 

Maybe tomorrow 
A new romance 
No more sorrow 
But that's the chance

You gotta take 
If your lonely heart breaks 
Only the lonely 

Dum-dum-dum-dumdy-doo-wah
