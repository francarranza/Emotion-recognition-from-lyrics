My eyes got blinded
And conned by the light
Like a fugitive on the run
I sought perseverance in the night

Deceptive icons were finally
Taken out of my sight
As the contender to origin
I will forever unveil his might

They say I am the cancer
On the back of the Inquisition
I may well be the cancer
In the heart of the Inquisition

They say I am the cancer
On the back of the Inquisition
I am the cancer
In the heart of the Inquisition

Through my years of sacrifice
Evolution came with lessons learned
Respect and fear
Is what I earned
So underestimate not your vision
Or you will be taught
Calculate your intuition
And you will teach

You all have been conned
And I always take the blame
For you do not understand
You are all the same
