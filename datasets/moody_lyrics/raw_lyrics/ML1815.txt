Well all right
Now dig this

You don't care for me
I don't care about that
You got a new fool
Ha
I like it like that
I have only one burning desire
Oh, can I make love with your fire

Let me stand next to your fire
Funky funky fire...
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky funky fire...
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky funky fire...
Let me stand next to your fire
Oh yeah

Now listen to this baby
And stop acting so crazy

You say your mom ain't home
Ain't my concern
Just don't play with me
And you won't get burned
I have only one burning desire
Oh, I'm gonna, me, do it in your fire

Let me stand next to your fire
Funky funky fire...
Let me stand next to your fire
Oh, funky fire...
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky funky fire...
Let me stand next to your fire
Oh yeah

Oh move over Rover...
And let Mr Huckleberry take over...
You know he's bad
You know he drowns
You know who he gives it to
Yeah!

That's right
Now dig this

You try to give me your money
You better save it babe
Save it for your rainy day
I have only one burning desire
Oh, can I make love over your fire

Let me stand next to your fire
Funky funky fire...
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky funky fire...
Let me stand next to your fire
Oh, funky fire...
Let me stand next to your fire

You better slide your ass over, girl
'Cause I'm coming through once and
I'm coming the way you must be
