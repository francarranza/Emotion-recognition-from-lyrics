I can't begin to explain
How we disassemble the parts and frame

Maybe it's the same late morning
The same no show
Yeah, it's the same fucking habits
I guess we don't know

All of this is tearing us apart
I don't know where us or this start
All of this is tearing us apart
I don't know where us or this start

If there's anyone near when we collide
We throw them in the middle, they can pick sides

As the plans turn into compromise
The promises all turn to lies
The spite builds up and I can't get through
Passive me,  aggressive you

I know I nag, I moan, I know
But with a plan like this, it's way too slow
In the time it took to get this bad
I could have made this work but all I had was
The hope that pieces would take shape
And we could watch them all fall into place

Fall into place
Fall into place
Fall into place
Fall into place

All of this is tearing us apart
I don't know where us or this start
All of this is tearing us apart
I don't know where us or this start

All of this is tearing us apart
I don't know where us or this start
All of this is tearing us apart
I don't know where us or this start
