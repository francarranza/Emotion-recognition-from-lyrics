Oh, little boy
Asleep in my arms tonight
Under the stars so bright
King of kings
What tidings of comfort and joy he brings
Son of man
From heaven above, you fell
Jehovah Emmanuel
Upon a midnight clear
I feel the love

It must be love
(The Father's love)
It's got to be his love
It must be his love that brought you here
Because of his love
That's why you're here
To give us hope for tomorrow
To take away the sorrow and fear
To wipe away the tears and love
Because of his love

Special one
Who came to set all men free
Now all heaven and earth will sing
Behold the newborn king
It's all because of his love

It must be love
(Got to be his love)
Got to be his love
It could only be his love that brought you here
Because of his love
That's why you're here
To give us hope for tomorrow
To take away the sorrow and fear
(Take away the sorrow and fear)
To wipe away the tears and love
Because of his love

Oh, close to my heart, I hold the sleeping savior
He came to chase all the darkness away
If there might be things I don't understand
(There might be things I don't understand)
I'll just keep holding on to your hand

Because of his love
That's why you're here
To give us hope for tomorrow
To take away the sorrow and fear
To wipe away the tears and love
Because of his love
