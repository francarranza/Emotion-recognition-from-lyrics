I was down on myself both day and night
I couldn't get a thing to go just right
I was hangin' by my thumb and slippin' on my feet
I had to take a break I couldn't stand the heat
Just when I thought I could never win
I was doing pretty good for the shape I was in

I went to the movies last night again
I couldn't stay long enough to see the end
'Cause there was something going on that I couldn't see
Everybody's making out in the balcony
I was missing out on the fun again
But I'm doing pretty good for the shape I'm in

I tried so hard to get back in the race
I'd just be satisfied if I could place
There's so much competition but the best don't always win
I'm doing pretty good for the shape I'm in

I went to a party and made a few passes
One was a dream and the other was nasty
Well, I guess you know by now that I did it again
But I was doing pretty good for the shape I was in
I was down like a dollar comin' up against a yen
I was doing pretty good for the shape I'm in
Doing pretty good for the shape I was in
Doing pretty good for the shape I was in
Doing pretty good for the shape I was in
