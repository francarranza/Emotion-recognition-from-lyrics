This is the death of me.
I feel it constantly
Just like an enemy
That wants to see me bleed
So I try to be silent while my words they explode like hand grenades
I just gotta stay calm, before I let this time bomb blow up in my face.

These issues pin me to the floor
These issues are my overlord
I feel so dominated
These issues, they choke my like a noose
Issues, they choke me like a noose
Issues, they choke me like a noose

The hounds of hell they cry
That's how they get to me
Inject my head with lies, the pains astonishing
Like a flick or a stone, slowing crushing my bones, sending me to my grave
And if such a fate this life that I am going insane

These issues pin me to the floor
These issues are my overlord
I feel so dominated
These issues, they choke my like a noose
Issues, they choke me like a noose
Issues, they choke me like a noose
Issues
Issues, they choke me like a noose

These issues pin me to the floor
These issues are my overlord
I feel so dominated
These issues, they choke my like a noose
Issues, they choke me like a noose
Issues, they choke me like a noose
Issues, they choke me like a noose
Issues, they choke me like a noose
