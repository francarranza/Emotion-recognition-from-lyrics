(Hal Blair/Dan Robertson)

I took you home from a party and we kissed and burned
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done
Instead of stopping when we could we went right on
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone
Oh you belong to someone else and I do too
It's just crazy bein' here with you
Like a bad motorcycyle with the devil in the seat

Goin' ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Goin' ninety miles an hour down a dead end street

I did not want to want you but now I have no choice
To late to listen to that whining voice
All I hear is thunder when two hearts beat

Goin' ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Goin' ninety miles an hour down a dead end street

Oh you're not free to belong to me
And you know that I could never be your own
But your lips on mine
Oh, the sweet, sweet wine
What are we going to do

Warning signs are flashing everywhere we pay no heed
Instead of slowing down the pace we're picking up speed
Disaster's getting closer every time we meet

Goin' ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Goin' ninety miles an hour down a dead end street

Goin' ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Disaster's getting closer every time we meet
