Jesus, King of my heart
Father, my peace and my light
Spirit, the joy of my soul You are

Jesus, to You none compare
Father, I rest in Your care
Spirit, the hope of my heart You are

The Heavens declare You are God
And the mountains rejoice
The oceans cry, "Alleluia"
As we worship You, Lord
For this is our song of love

Jesus, You save my soul
I'll thank You forevermore
Jesus, the love of my life You are

The Heavens declare You are God
And the mountains rejoice
The oceans cry, "Alleluia"
As we worship You, Lord
For this is our song of love

Jesus, I am in awe
Of the love that You have shown
Jesus, how precious You are to me, to me

The Heavens declare You are God
And the mountains rejoice
The oceans cry, "Alleluia"
As we worship You, Lord

The Heavens declare You are God
And the mountains rejoice
The oceans cry, "Alleluia"
As we worship You, Lord
As we worship You, Lord
For this is our song of love

Our song of love, our song of love
This is our song of love
Our song of love, our song of love
Our song of love, this is our song of love
