'Cause You're a God who has all things

And I need You to love me, and I
I won't keep my heart from You this time
And I'll stop this pretending that I can
Somehow deserve what I already have

Your love makes me forget what I have been
Your love makes me see who I really am
Your love makes me forget what I have been

I need You to love me
I need You to love me
I need You to love me
And I'll stop this pretending that I can
Somehow deserve what I already have
Somehow deserve what I already have
I need You to love me
I need You to
