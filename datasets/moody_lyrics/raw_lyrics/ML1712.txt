Christmas just ain't Christmas
Without the one you love
New Years just ain't New Years
Without the one you love

Underneath the mistletoe
I saw a face all aglow
Last year this time

Now I'm staying home alone
And my house is not a home
Without that girl of mine

Christmas just ain't Christmas
Without the one you love
And New Years just ain't New Years
Without the one you love

Twelve o'clock and all is well
And I was doing oh, so swell
Last year, this time

Goin' shopping with friends together
Making vows to leave each other, never
It was a waste of time

Christmas just ain't Christmas
Without the one you love
New Years just ain't New Years
Without the one you love

Christmas just ain't Christmas
Without the one you love
New Years just ain't New Years
Without the one you love

Christmas just ain't Christmas
Without the one you love
New Years just ain't New Years
Without the one you love

Christmas just ain't Christmas
Without the one you love
