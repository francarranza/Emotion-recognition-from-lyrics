My heart is heavy as lead
Because the blues has done spread
Rocks in my bed

Of all the people I see
Why do they pick on poor me
And put rocks in my bed

All night long I weep
So how can I sleep
With rocks in my bed

There's only two kinds of people
I can't understand
There's only two kinds of people
I can't understand
That's a deceitful woman
And a hard faced man

She took my man away
And ain't goin' bring him back
She took my man away
And ain't goin' bring him back
She's lower than a snake down in a wagon track

I got rocks in my bed
I got rocks in my bed
Rocks in my bed
I got rocks in my bed

Under-loved, over-fed
My man's gone, so instead
I got rocks in my bed
Under-loved, over-fed
My man's gone, so instead
I got rocks in my bed
