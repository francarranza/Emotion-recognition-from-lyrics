I am a man
I am self-aware
And everywhere I go
You are always right there with me
I flirted with you all my life
Even kissed you once or twice
And to this day I swear it was nice
But clearly I was not ready.
When you touched a friend of mine
I thought I would lose my mind
And I found out with time
That really I was not ready, no, no
Oh death, oh death, oh death, really, I'm not ready

Oh death, 
You me 
Decimate those dear to me

Teased me with your sweet release
You are full and you are constant.
When my Mom she was cancer sick, 
She fought but then succumbed to it
But you made her beg for it
Sweet Jesus, please I'm ready.

Oh death, oh death, oh death
Really, I'm not ready, no no no.
I'm not ready
I'm not ready
No, no
Oh death, oh death, 
Really, I'm not ready.
