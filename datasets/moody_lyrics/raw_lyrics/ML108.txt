There's a reggae party here tonight
Braddahs on the left, Sistahs on the right
The bass is bumpin the music is right
So don't you go home lonely tonight
Is everybody ready to dance
Grab a partner and get on the dance floor and skank
This may be your last chance

Chorus: It's a two person party tonight
Take off your clothes I'll turn off the lights
Don't worry girl I'll have you home on time
(This is what I'm telling you)
It's a two person party tonight

Oh girl tell me what I'm seein'
You and me together that's the feelin'
Let's start now we don't have much time
Makin' sweet love till the morning light
You're the only woman that I see
Would you like to come and dance with me
I think God made you for me

Verse 2 (repeat):
