You're beautiful, and that's for sure
You'll never, ever fade
You're lovely, but it's not for sure
That I won't ever change
And though my love is rare
Though my love is true

I'm like a bird, I only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (soul is)
I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is

Your faith in me brings me to tears
Even after all these years
And it pains me so much to tell
That you don't know me that well
And though my love is rare
Though my love is true

I'm like a bird, I only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away (I don't know)
I don't know where my soul is (soul is)
I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is

It's not that I wanna say goodbye
It's just that every time you try 
To tell me, me that you love me, oh (oh)
Each and every single day
I know I'm going to have to eventually give you away...
And though my love is rare, rare, rare
And though my love is true... yeah
I'm just scared...
That we may fall through-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woowoo...

Yeah, yeah
I'm like a bird (I'm like a bird)
I don't know where my soul is (soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is

I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away (fly away)
I don't know where my soul is (soul is)
I don't know where my home is (ahh it's true)
And baby all I need for you to know is

I'm like a bird, I only fly away (And I don't know where my soul is)
I don't know where my soul is (I don't know where my home is)
I don't know where my home is (no)
And baby all I need for you to know is

I'm like a bird, I only fly away (I don't know where my soul is)
I don't know where my soul is (I don't know where my home is))
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (soul is)
I don't know where my home is
