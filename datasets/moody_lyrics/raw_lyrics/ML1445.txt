Say it over and over again
Over and over again
Never stop saying you're mine

Tell me ever and ever so sweet
Soft words of love be repeating
Just like an old valentine

When you say I love you
The same old I love you
They whisper in stories and plays

You can change I love you
The same old I love you
To oh such a heavenly phrase

So tell me softly and gently
And over and over again
Never stop saying you're mine

When you say I love you
The same old I love you
They whisper in stories and plays

You can change I love you
Same old I love you
To oh such a heavenly phrase

So tell me softly and gently
And over and over again
Never stop saying you're mine

Never stop saying that you're mine
Always say you're mine, my love
Never stop telling me you're mine
