(Feat. Mario)

I let the roof drop
Drippin - with super -
In my new car
And I'm glad that she love to have me
I'm like ooh lord
From Jamaica to Puerto Rico down to Utah
From Miami to California they some cool brahs
Haters tell me they can't be mad at my new job
We be goin' hard in the - like a hoop star
It's finger li- lickin' good like a full course
Give it to ya girl don't have to tell you baby
You start if you like it you know I love it
Baby, 2 more
And the smell of that new chanel girl, it never fail
We can fly away or just drive
Baby, heads or tails?
And oh yeah, and oh yeah

Said I met a lot of ladies and I travel the world
Sometimes I party like crazy showin love to the girls
That's how I go, that's how I go girl, that's how I go girl
I go and go, that's how I go girl, that's how I go girl
And then my pockets look - with plenty to give
Somebody 'bout to have my baby and the key to my crib
That's how I go, that's how I go girl, that's how I go girl
I go and go, that's how I go girl, that's how I go girl

I said man girl you think it's 5 o'clock traffic on that 101
Maybe later on tonight me and you can have ourselves a 1 on 1
I swear I've seen you somewhere else
Maybe it was on a movie screen
Maybe it was on a television
Or on the cover of a magazine
I know and I don't care
Let me see your underwear
Let me see how thick you is baby
Let me see what's under there
Everybody know we go go go go oh so fast when I'm on my grind
But I can't lie when I see that ass
I slow it down and take my time

Said I met a lot of ladies and I travel the world
Sometimes I party like crazy showin love to the girls
That's how I go, that's how I go girl, that's how I go girl
I go and go, that's how I go girl, that's how I go girl
And then my pockets look - with plenty to give
Somebody 'bout to have my baby and the key to my crib
That's how I go, that's how I go girl, that's how I go girl
I go and go, that's how I go girl, that's how I go girl

Girl I gotta red eye flight, soundcheck, another photo shoot
Girl I gotta go I gotta do another interview
Studio tonight have a banger you could listen to
Baby you ain't even gotta ask
You know I'm missin' you
The money keep comin' girl, 'cause we keep goin'
Yeah we go and go and go and go and go and keep goin'
Yeah the money keep comin' girl, 'cause we keep goin'
Yeah we go and go and go and go and go and keep goin'

Said I met a lot of ladies and I travel the world
Sometimes I party like crazy showin love to the girls
That's how I go, that's how I go girl, that's how I go girl
I go and go, that's how I go girl, that's how I go girl
And then my pockets look - with plenty to give
Somebody 'bout to have my baby and the key to my crib
That's how I go, that's how I go girl, that's how I go girl
I go and go, that's how I go girl, that's how I go girl

That's how we go.
