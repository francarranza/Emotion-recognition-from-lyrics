Well, I never kept a dollar past sunset
It always burned a hole in my pants
Never made a school mama happy
Never blew a second chance, oh no

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me happy
Baby, baby keep me happy
Baby, baby keep me happy

Always took candy from strangers
Didn't wanna get me no trade
Never wanna be like papa
Working for the boss every night and day

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love, baby, won't y'keep me happy
Baby, won't y'keep me happy
Baby, please keep me

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me happy
Baby, baby, keep me happy
Baby

Never got a flash out of cocktails
When I got some flesh off the bone
Never got a lift out of Lear jets
When I can fly way back home

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me happy
Baby, baby, keep me happy
Baby, baby, keep me happy
Baby

Happy
Baby won't y'keep me, happy
Baby won't y'keep me, happy
Baby won't y'keep me, happy
Baby won't y'keep me, happy
Baby won't y'keep me, happy
Baby won't y'keep me, happy
Oh, keep on dancin'
Keep me, happy
Now, baby, won't you squeeze me
Happy
C'mon, baby, got a feelin'
Happy
Now now now now now
Keep me happy
Try mama
Keep me happy
Keep on dancin'
Keep me happy
Keep on dancin'
Keep me happy
