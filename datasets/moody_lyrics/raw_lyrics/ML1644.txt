My sweet, sweet, sweet baby girl
Sweetest girl in the whole wide world
She reminds me daily that love is a beautiful thing

Sweet sugar dumpling your love is really something
Your love is really something to see
You remind me everyday that love is a beautiful thing

Well simply put it's not too hard to see
All the joy that good loving brings
And it makes me so proud to say babe
Love can be a beautiful thing

You remind me everyday that love is a beautiful thing
Baby, baby let my sun shine, your lovely smile is so kind
You remind me daily that love is a beautiful thing

Even a blind man can plainly see
All the joy that good love brings
And it makes me so proud to say babe
Love can be a beautiful thing

What a tragedy it would be if you fail to see
All the joy that good love brings
And it makes me so proud to sing baby
Love can be a beautiful thing

One thing for sure is your love is a beautiful thing
Love is a beautiful thing, love is a beautiful thing
Love is a beautiful thing, love is a beautiful thing
Love is a beautiful thing, beautiful thing
