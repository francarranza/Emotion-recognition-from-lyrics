Oh there were others and some were friends
And some were merrily lovers
But they all helped me discover
It's so hard to find someone who'll be true

And I said no way, would I fall again oh no, no way
There's just too many heartaches
And I don't like the way it feels to feel my heart break
Then there was you

You're the best break this old heart ever had
You're all the good luck that I'll never need to have
Never thought I'd ever love again like that
You're the best break this old heart ever had

All around me
My world was crumbling down all around me
Oh but then you found me
And with your love you mended my life

You're the best break this old heart ever had
You're all the good luck that I'll never need to have
Never thought I'd ever love again like that
You're the best break this old heart ever had

You're the best break this old heart ever had
You're all the good luck that I'll never need to have
Never thought I'd ever love again like that
You're the best break this old heart ever had
You're the best break this old heart ever had
