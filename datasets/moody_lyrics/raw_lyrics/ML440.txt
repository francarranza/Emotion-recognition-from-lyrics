Penny lover don't walk on by
Penny lover don't you make me cry
Can't you see girl who my heart's beating for
You're the only girl that I adore

The first time I saw you
Oh you looked so fine
And I had a feeling
One day you'd be mine

Honey you came along and captured my heart
Now my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
When I'm all alone it's you that I miss
Girl a love like yours is hard to resist
Whoa whoa

Penny lover my love's on fire
Penny lover you're my one desire
Tell me baby now could this be true
That I can need someone like I need you

Nights warm and tender
Lying next to you
Girl I surrender
What more can I do

I spent all of my life in search of your love
Now there's one more thing I'd like to say
Don't you ever take your sweet love away
Girl I'll do anything just please stay
Whoa whoa

I don't understand it
Oh what's come over me
But I'm not gonna worry
No not anymore

'Cause when a man's in love he's only got one story
That's why my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
When I'm lost and alone it's you that I miss
With a love like yours it's hard to resist
Whoa whoa

Don't you walk on by
Don't you make me cry baby
Don't you walk on by
Oh pretty baby

Don't you walk on by
I remember the first time I saw you baby
You had the look in your eye
You had the look in your eye
Yeah ooh pretty baby

I just want to reach out and touch you baby
I want to reach out and hold you
Hold you and say ooh
Whoa whoa oh my

I want to talk with you every day
Need you baby
Need you baby
Oh Penny

Oh Penny baby
Can't you see I need you baby
Don't you walk on by
Ooh ooh

Can't you see I need you
I need you baby
My Penny

Don't you walk on by
Oh oh Penny

My baby
