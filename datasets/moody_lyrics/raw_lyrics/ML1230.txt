Greeting cards have all been sent
The Christmas rush is through
But I still have one wish to make
A special one for you

Merry Christmas, darling
We're apart, that's true
But I can dream and in my dreams
I'm Christmasing with you

Holidays are joyful
There's always something new
But every day is a holiday
When I'm near to you

The lights on my tree
I wish you could see
I wish it every day
The logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say

That I wish you merry Christmas
Happy New Year too
I've just one wish on this Christmas Eve
I wish I were with you

The logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say

That I wish you merry Christmas
Happy New Year too
I've just one wish on this Christmas Eve
I wish I were with you
I wish I were with you

Merry Christmas, darling
