Feels like the walls are closing in on me
I'm suffocating, I can barely breathe
You've got me right where you want me

This is the side of you I've never seen
You're not the girl that you used to be
And you've got me right where you want me

You always know how to bring me down
Let's just face it now I'm never changing

You are my world, my everything
You stupid girl, you will be the death of me
So let me go, just let me be
You stupid girl, I love the way you're killing me
You stupid girl

You're like an angel but with broken wings
A heart so cold can never show mercy
And you've got me right where you want me

You are my world, my everything
You stupid girl, you will be the death of me
So let me go, just let me be
You stupid girl, love the way you're killing me
You stupid girl

You stupid girl

I know I'm a bastard, I'm not a coward
Why can't you see what you're doing to me? [x2]

Open your eyes, open your eyes

This is killing me

You are my world, my everything
You stupid girl, you will be the death of me
So let me go, just let me be
You stupid girl, love the way you're killing me
(You're killing me)
You stupid girl
