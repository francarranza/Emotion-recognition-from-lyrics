Joy is the gift He brings

Joy is the song we sing
Joy may cover everything

Joy, joy to the world

Joy to the world, the Lord is come!

Let earth receive her King;

Let every heart prepare Him room,

And Heaven and nature sing,

And Heaven and nature sing,

And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing.

Joy to the world, the Savior reigns!

(Brian)

Let men their songs employ;

While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains

Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,

Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy.
