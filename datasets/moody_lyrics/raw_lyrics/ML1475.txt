You, you never call
You never write me or nothing
I set myself up to fall
I was stupid then to try
And I'll live in a lie
I made a fantasy world but the hero won't win this time
'Cause your pipedream gets flushed away

By all means I'm getting mad
That don't mean I don't feel sorry for you

How sad you're gonna be
I wish I could stick around
To see your face when you realize you've permanently changed
And it's all thanks to me I was wrong for coming here
You'll wake alone and run around your lonely home
Look for my face but I'm already gone

You, you never call
You never write me or nothing
I set myself up to fall
I was stupid then to try
There was something in the way
Something in the way
Something in the way
That you shut the door
I couldn't get enough when you blow me off
I just kept dragging myself back for more

By all means I'm getting mad
That don't mean I don't feel sorry for you

How sad you're gonna be
I wish I could stick around
To see your face when you realize you've permanently changed
And it's all thanks to me I was wrong for coming here
You'll wake alone and run around your lonely home
Look for my face but I'm already gone

One day you're gonna see the life sentence you gave to me
But I swear one day we will share this cell
I know it's cold but I will keep us warm with all the hate I radiate
We'll be walking hand in hand in hell
(We'll be walking hand in hand in hell)

How sad you're gonna be
I wish I could stick around
To see your face when you realize you've permanently changed
And it's all thanks to me I was wrong for coming here
You'll wake alone and run around your lonely home
Look for my face but I'm already gone
