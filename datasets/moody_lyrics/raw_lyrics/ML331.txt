Sometimes I'm afraid of what I might not get to say
Sometimes I believe that everything is what it seems
And we're just to scared to try
Do we have what it takes when hope and clarity melt away
To rise above our mistakes
If we don't know any other way
And we're just too scared to try

When it feels like there is nothing left
It feels like this is as good as it gets
It feels that way sometimes
So let's take a second and catch our breath
And realize this isn't over yet
It just feels that way sometimes

Sometimes there can be so much more beyond what we see
Sometimes I'm amazed how we see the world in different ways
And we're just too scared to try

When it feels like there is nothing left
It feels like this is as good as it gets

It feels that way sometimes
So let's take a second and catch our breath
And realize this isn't over yet
It just feels that way sometimes

Sometimes I'm afraid of what I might not get to say
And we're just too scared to try
Yeah we're just too scared to try

When it feels like there is nothing left
It feels like this is as good as it gets
It feels that way sometimes
So let's take a second and catch our breath
And realize this isn't over yet
It just feels that way sometimes
So let's take a second and catch our breath
And realize this isn't over yet
It just feels that way sometimes
