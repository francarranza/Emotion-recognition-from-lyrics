Covenant of pure corruption
Sink my teeth deep into you
Solemn oath of sheer Destruction
Nightmare, through and through

In that hour - I'll devour
Hope is swallowed up in Pain
Taste the venom - feel the power
Coursing through my veins

I'm corruption
I'm destruction, through and through

Trust in Me... for I will set you free
With a Serpent's Kiss
With a Serpent's Kiss

Be my Light and I won't stray - make me beg;
Make me pray
Tell me when to laugh or cry - when to live and when to die

Forgotten and betrayed
Rotting and decayed
Left to wither - without a voice
Left to slither - without a choice

Crucifier - spitting Fire
Say your little empty prayers
This Empire - growing higher
...To this spite, I swear

Sharp tongue severs - like a razor
Swimming in a sea of Rage
Vindicators - masqueraders
All the World's my Stage

I devour
I empower - God of Pain

Trust in me... for I will set you free
With a Serpent's Kiss
How could it come to this?
With a Serpent's Kiss
