Yo this gurl is so hot... so sexy

Everytime I turn around the boys fightin over me
Everytime I step out the house they want to fight over me
Maybe 'cause I'm hot to death and I'm so so so sexy
All the boyz all the silly boyz they want to fight over me

Everytime I turn around the boys fightin over me
Everytime I step out the house they want to fight over me
Maybe 'cause I'm hot to death and I'm so so so sexy
All the boyz all the silly boyz they want to fight over me

(Jadakiss)
We in the VIP killing the oncen
Whoever ain't two stepping is really bouncing yeah
You know the name of the game
So let go of your dame
She chose me ever since the DJ announce them
She got the right to
Low button down or wire saleshades the ice is bright too
And I'm around goons
Moms gonna let me get her
Promise to send her back tomorrow around noon
Soar looser but a good winner
Besides she could use a lil hood in her
A 40 from auto bond and a hood dinner
With a binner and a rage back sit at the cina
Get violent money wanna drop me
Its something on the tip of my plakyness spit silence
I don't feel haters and if you feeling sum kinda way email them and tell them you still jadakisss

Everytime I turn around the boys fightin over me
Everytime I step out the house they want to fight over me
Maybe 'cause I'm hot to death and I'm so so so sexy
All the boyz all the silly boyz they want to fight over me
Boyz boyz boyz boyz fighting over me
