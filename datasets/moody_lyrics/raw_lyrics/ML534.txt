I hear the sound of a voice
Crying out in the wilderness
(Prepare ye the way of the Lord)
I hear the sound of a voice
It sounds like thunder
(Prepare ye the way of the Lord, ooh)

This is a war cry
Calling all of the warriors
(With your weapons fit for the fight)
We must stand as a people
Filled with His light

Prepare ye the way
Of the Lord, Lord, Lord
Prepare ye the way
Of the Lord, Lord, Lord

The Creator is waiting for us
To acknowledge Him
(Prepare ye the way of the Lord)
So I will sing and I will shout
Till He returns for me
(Prepare ye the way of the Lord, ooh)

Let us kneel down
And reverence His presence
(So all the world will see)
That He is faithful and just
Deserving all glory

Oh, oh, oh
We're waiting on our Savior
Oh, oh, oh, oh
We're waiting on our King
Oh, oh, oh
We're waiting on our Master
Oh, oh, oh, oh
He is our everything

This a war cry
For the warriors
Pick up your weapons
It's time to fight

This a war cry
For the warriors
Pick up your weapons
Fight, fight

This is a war cry
For the warriors
Prepare ye the way of the Lord (5x)
