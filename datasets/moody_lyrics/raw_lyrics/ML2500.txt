It's time to put away our
Guns and ammunition
We can do it if we try
I tell you what the reason
Causing all the friction
Discrimination is a crime

We can do it
If we try
Let war and hatred
Pass us by

We can do it if we try
Let war and hate just pass us by
We can do it if we try
Right now! Ah ha ha

My generation
God help the children
My generation
God help the children

If parents only had more
Time for understanding
The youth won't have to turn to drugs
There's only one solution
Causing all the problem
We talking universal love

We can do it
If we try
Let war and hatred
Pass us by

We can do it if we try
Let war and hate just pass us by
We can do it if we try
Right now! Ah ha ha

My generation
God help the children
My generation
God help the children

Rap: pato banton
It's time to stop and think about
What you done to others
And if it's good we'll go ahead
And JAH will sure protect you
But if it's bad just watch your step
Cause you will surely stumble
Remember who inherit the land
The meek and very humble

My generation
God help the children
My generation
God help the children

David:
