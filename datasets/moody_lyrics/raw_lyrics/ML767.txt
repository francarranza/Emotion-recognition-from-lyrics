I should have known better with a guy like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey hey hey, and I do

Whoa whoa I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

That when I tell you that I love you
You're gonna say you love me too
Oh oh, and when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

Whoa whoa, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

That when I tell you that I love you
You're gonna say you love me too
Oh, and when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

You love me too...
