If our lips should meet in Innamorata
Kiss me kiss me sweet in Innamorata
Hold me close and say you're mine
I heaven's door in Innamorata
Want you more and more in Innamorata
You're a symphony the very beautiful sonanta my in Innamorata
Say that you're my sweetheart, my love

You're a symphony the very beautiful sonanta my in Innamorata
Say that you're my sweetheart, my one and only sweetheart
Say you're my sweetheart, my love
