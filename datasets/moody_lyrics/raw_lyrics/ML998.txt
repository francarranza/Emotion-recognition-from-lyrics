Got a ticket on the mainline
I was stranded on the fault line
I got wasted on the moonshine
Too far gone

I was walking in the sundown
I was heading for the breakdown
When you're sleeping on the cold ground
Too far gone

There was a cloud hanging over me
Something just reached out and grabbed a hold of me

Inside of the belly of the whale
Outside they was beatin' on the door
Somebody goin' down tonight
I said boys he don't live here no more
He don't live here no more

I was riding on the night train
I been moving in the fast lane
I was only trying to kill the pain
Too far gone

I was running on a red light

Always looking for a street fight
I was higher than a lost kite
Too far gone

When you're waiting for the axe to drop
When you're hooked so bad you could not stop

Inside of the belly of the whale
Outside they was beatin' on the door
Somebody goin' down tonight
I said boys he don't live here no more
He don't live here no more

Got no one to blame but myself
They couldn't hear my distant cry for help

Inside of the belly of the whale
Outside they was beatin' on the door
Somebody's goin' down tonight
I said boys he don't live here no more
He don't live here no more
