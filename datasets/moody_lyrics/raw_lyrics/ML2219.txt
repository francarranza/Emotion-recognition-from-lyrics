Think of your fellow man 
Lend him a helping hand 
Put a little love in your heart 
You see it's getting late 
Oh, please don't hesitate 
Put a little love in your heart 

And the world will be a better place 
And the world will be a better place 
For you and me 
You just wait and see 

Another day goes by 
Still the children cry 
Put a little love in your heart 
If you want the world to know 
We won't let hatred grow 
Put a little love in your heart 

And the world (and the world) will be a better place 
All the world (all the world) will be a better place 
For you (for you) 
And me (and me) 
You just wait (just wait) 
And see, wait and see 

Take a good look around 
And if you're looking down 
Put a little love in your heart 
I hope when you decide 
Kindness will be your guide 
Put a little love in your heart 

And the world (and the world) will be a better place 
And the world (and the world) will be a better place 
For you (for you) 
And me (and me) 
You just wait (just wait) 
And see 

People, now put a little love in your heart 
Each and every day 
Put a little love in your heart 
There's no other way 
Put a little love in your heart 
It's up to you 
Put a little love in your heart 
C'mon and ... 
Put a little love in your heart
