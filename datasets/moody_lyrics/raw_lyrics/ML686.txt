Why do people smile when no one's smiling?
It's 'cause they're thinking of someone they're loving
Keep on believing we are meant to me and
Nothing's stopping you and me from going to heaven
Sweetest love

I got the sweetest love there ain't nothing sweeter
I got the sweetest love ain't nothing beat it
There ain't nothing sweeter

Now we're clever is about to inch just one ladder
It gets better every second we're together
Oh baby it feels so right
A new beginning starts tonight
The reason for when it's on
Is because of you and me and
Sweetest love

Finally I can't believe
'Cause you and me, you're my sweetest love

I got the sweetest love there ain't nothing sweeter
I got the sweetest love ain't nothing beat it
There ain't nothing sweeter

I got the sweetest love there ain't nothing sweeter
I got the sweetest love ain't nothing beat it
There ain't nothing sweeter

Now I got that feeling in my gut
Now I need your fire in my life
Now I wanna give you love so much
And I keep on feeling my sweet, my sweet
Sweetest love

I can't believe that you and me, we gotta be
You're my sweetest love

I got the sweetest love there ain't nothing sweeter
I got the sweetest love ain't nothing beat it
There ain't nothing sweeter

I got the sweetest love there ain't nothing sweeter
I got the sweetest love ain't nothing beat it
There ain't nothing sweeter

I got the sweetest love there ain't nothing sweeter
I got the sweetest love ain't nothing beat it
There ain't nothing sweeter

I got the sweetest love there ain't nothing sweeter
I got the sweetest love ain't nothing beat it
There ain't nothing sweeter

Sweetest love
I can't believe, you and me, we gotta be
Oh my sweetest love
