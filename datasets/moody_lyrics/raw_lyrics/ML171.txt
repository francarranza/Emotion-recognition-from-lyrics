Bandages on my legs and my arms from you
Bandages, bandages, bandages
Up and down on my legs and my arms from you
Bandages, bandages, bandages

These bandages cover more than scrapes
Cuts and bruises from regrets and mistakes
I've been hoping you're moping around the street again
I've been tripping from sipping the dripping dirty water tap
I've been poking a voodoo doll that you do not know I made

These bandages are anonymity
I've been shaking from making an awful decision
I've been running and running feels like my head is spinning round 
And round, around, around, around, around, around

Bandages on my legs and my arms from you
Bandages, bandages, bandages
Up and down on my legs and my arms from you
Bandages, bandages, bandages

I've been hoping your moping around the street again 
I've been tripping from sipping the dripping dirty water tap
I've been poking a voodoo doll that you do not know I made 
For you, of you 
Let's see what needles do

I've been shaking from making an awful decision
I've been thinking I'm drinking too many drinks all by myself
I've been running and running feels like my head is spinning round 
And round and round, around, around, around, around

Don't worry now, don't worry now
Don't worry 'cause it will all turn around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
