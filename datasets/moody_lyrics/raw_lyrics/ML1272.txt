You'll never reach the surface
Never reach the surface
Surfing underneauth the goddamn truth

Piercing the shield
Piercing the shield
Piercing the shield within your mind

Piercing the shield
Piercing the shield
Piercing the shield within your mind

(Within your mind)
Within your mind
The truth is fading away
Will I ever get through?

No matter the pain
No matter if it's in vain (if it's in vain)
No matter the pain
No matter if you get insane
No matter if you get insane

You feel so fucking down
Don't you feel alive
You feel so fucking down
Don't you feel alive

You're just a time bomb
No matter if you're right or wrong
This is just your damn song
No matter if you're right or fucking wrong

No matter the pain
No matter if it's in vain (if it's in vain)
No matter the pain
No matter if you get insane

No matter the pain
No matter if it's in vain (if it's in vain)
No matter the pain
No matter if you get insane
No matter if you get insane

No matter if it's in vain
No matter if you get insane

No matter the pain
No matter if it's in vain (if it's in vain)
No matter the pain
No matter if you get insane
