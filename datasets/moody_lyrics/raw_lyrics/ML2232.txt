Young, dumb, don't see a problem
Bloodshot, stare like a hoodlum
Simple as this, I'm in love with the risk
I know what I've done, but tell me what did I miss?
So, please don't save something
Waste not, save nothing
Lose the halo, don't need to resist
I lick on my lips, and I grip on your hips

Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist
Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist

First thing we succumb to
Shall erase and undo
Days are unreleased, if there's no police
Race to slip into whatever fits you
Make something, make someone
Beg on a knee, baby, baby, please
Pout your bottom lip while cracking the whip
You know what we want is candy to cum to

Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist
Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist
Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist
Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist

A total eclipse
In the teeth of the risk
The tongue is a twist
Perpetual bliss
Forever midnight
Forever midnight
Forever midnight
Forever

Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist
Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist

Sick sick, sick (I'm gonna take)
Don't resist (I don't wanna choose)
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)
Don't resist (I don't wanna change)

Sick sick, sick (I'm gonna take)
Don't resist (I don't wanna choose)
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)
Don't resist (I don't wanna change)
Sick sick, sick (I'm gonna take)
Don't resist (I don't wanna choose)
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)
Don't resist (I don't wanna change)
