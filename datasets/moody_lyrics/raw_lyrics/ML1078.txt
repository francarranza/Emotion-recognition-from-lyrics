All the wrong things to be said, we've said 'em.
We let anger guide the way.
I say you're at fault; you say I'm selfish.
Now the accusations must be paid with the strain of
Losing you, pain
Of feeling blue.
You're hurt and I'm lost,
Tell me what are we gonna do?
Please come back and kiss away the pain;
We can be happy once again.
Please come back and kiss away the pain;
We can make sunshine from the rain.
Without you, my life has no music
Rhyme and rhythm cease to be.
Close friends tell me that you're acting heartsick,
Is it all because you're missing me?
The pain is clouding your eyes
Pain too deep to disguise
You're blue, baby I am too.
Tell me, tell me, tell me what are we gonna do?
Please come back and kiss away the pain;
We can be happy once again.
Please come back and kiss away the pain;

We can make sunshine from the rain.
Please come back baby, please come back baby, kiss it
Away.
We don't even have to explain,
Please come back and kiss away my pain.
Lost love is such a shame.
Your kiss is guaranteed to take all the pain,
Take all the pain, take all the pain away from me.
Please come kiss away the pain
