Well ya can't sit still
Nobody asked you to
When you close your eyes
Darling does it look so fine
In the morning light
Can't even see your face
In the morning light
I can't even see your face

In your heart
In your heart
It's a start
In your heart

In your heart
In your heart
Darlin' it's a start
Darlin' in your heart

Sitting next to me
Nobody could sympathize
Only in my dreams
Everything comes to life

In your heart
In your heart
It's a start
In your heart

In your heart
In your heart
Darlin' it's a start
Darlin' in your heart

In your heart
In your heart
Darlin' it's a start
Darlin' in your heart
