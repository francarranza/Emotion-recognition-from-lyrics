Over the stars, in through the halls
We'll go far

We're in the business
The freedom line
We got the patience if you've got the time
We're in the business
The liberty rhyme
We got the widom if you've got the mind

Over the stars, in through the halls
We'll go far

We're in the business
The freedom line
We got the vision if you've got the eye
We're in the business
The liberty rhyme
We got the diamonds if you've got the crown

Over the stars, in through the halls
We'll go far
