It feels like a lifetime,
A thousand days have passed by
Since I held you close to me
If I could see that smile from my friend
I know that I could live again
I need you here with me

Heaven knows what to say
Even though for right
Now you're so far away
I hope and I pray
Somewhere in your heart I'll always stay

Girl, lately my sun doesn't shine without you
Never noticed what it feels like to be without you
Feels like I took my last step
And my last breath in my life ending
Had to say just what I was feeling girl
'Cause my sun doesn't shine,
Sun doesn't shine without you

This is more for me than for you
Girl, I finally see there's no substitute
For what we have
Do you know how much I love you

And what we share I can't forget
Girl a love like yours I'll never let just slip away
Just promise that you'll stay

Heaven knows what to say
Even though for right now you're so far away
Gonna tell you and show you
Do whatever I can do to get back to you

Girl, lately my sun doesn't shine without you
Never noticed what it feels like to be without you
Feels like I took my last step
And my last breath in my life ending
Had to say just what I was feeling, girl
'Cause my sun doesn't shine,
Sun doesn't shine

Have you ever seen a flower that never blooms?
Seen a starless night without the moon
Well that's me without you
So come back and turn my nights into days

Girl, lately my sun doesn't shine without you
Never noticed what it feels like to be without you
Feels like I took my last step
And my last breath in my life ending
Had to say just what I was feeling, girl
'Cause my sun doesn't shine,
Sun doesn't shine without you
