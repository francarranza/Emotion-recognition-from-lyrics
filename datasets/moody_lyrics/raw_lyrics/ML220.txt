You tear me then you pick me up
I won't forget
You take it all but still it's not enough
You tear me down then you pick me up
I won't forget
You try to tell my you can heal me
But I'm still bleeding and you'll be the death of me

I should have seen all these signs around me
But I was comfortable inside these wounds
So go ahead and take another piece of me now
While we all bow down to you

You'd be the death of me
You'd be the death of me

You tear me down and then you pick me up
I won't forget
You take it all but still it's not enough
You tear me down and then you pick me up
I won't forget
You try to tell me you can heal me
But I'm still bleeding and you'll be the death of me

I won't forget
I cannot forget this
I won't forget
I'll never forget this
I won't forget
I cannot forget this
I won't forget
I'll never forget

You'd be the death of me
You'd be the death of me
