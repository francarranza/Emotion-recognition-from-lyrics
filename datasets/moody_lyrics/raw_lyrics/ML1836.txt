It's your voice
In my ear
It's your perfume
In the air it's your smile
And your laugh
It's the greatest feelin' that I've ever had
I'm into you girl
I get confident
Each time you call my name
I'm into you ooh girl
I guess I must admit I'm finally tuned in
I'm into you oh girl
From your hair
To your toes
You're like sunshine
To my soul
Every move that you make
Tastes like candy
To my brain

In love with you
And I'm hoping you love me too
And I'm havin'
