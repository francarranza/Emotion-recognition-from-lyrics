You are my fire you take me higher
And I can't deny her cause you making everything all right
You are my fire you take me higher
And I can't deny her and you know I need you in my life

Early in the morning waking up to the beat
It's a good ol day got a kiss on my cheek
Feel like a boss so I get fresh dressed
Dimed to the jim we ain't havin' that stress
Hold 'em like I'm doing something
Getting paid
Doing what I'm doing so you know I gotta play
Out my way
So I bounce to the store where's the Don Diego
What I'm looking for
Party time you the fine design
Without you girl my life would expire
So sing to me baby Imma sing to you
Stay true to me lady, stay true to you
Uh best spot you will invade my mind
And guess what you just my kind
Rain or shine you always got my back
Take me to cloud nine just like that

You are my fire you take me higher
And I can't deny her cause you making everything all right
You are my fire you take me higher
And I can't deny her and you know I need you in my life

You are my fire you take me higher
And I can't deny her cause you making everything all right
You are my fire you take me higher
And I can't deny her and you know I need you in my life

(Uh uh oh uh oh you take me higher
Uh uh oh just light my fire)

Big Snoop Dogg hit it twist it droll
Put the petal to the metal
Go against the floor
High powered is the label Mr. Criminal
Capone young low let me get that homes
Lady P the First lady D O dub
Westcoast to the fullest
Tryna show y'all love
No doubt dogg house tryna burn one out
If I see a lil freak imma turn one out
Get in the coop smash out in my po
Ballin of course next level hand on the wheel
Pressin on the petal
Do what a pimp say baby caliente so cool
Way smoothe check this boo stop by slick by
Wave bye on the low stole the show
What it do brand new deja vu me and you maybe boo
What it do?

You are my fire you take me higher
And I can't deny her cause you making everything all right
You are my fire you take me higher
And I can't deny her and you know I need you in my life

And I can't deny her cause you making everything all right
You are my fire you take me higher
And I can't deny her and you know I need you in my life
