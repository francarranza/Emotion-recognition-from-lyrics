Diamond Girl
You sure do shine
Glad I found you
Glad you're mine

Oh, my love
You're like a precious stone
Part of earth where
Heaven has rained on

Makes no difference
Where you are
Day or night time
You're like a shining star

And how could I
Shine without you
When it's about you
That I am, woah, oh

Diamond Girl
Roaming wild
Such a rare thing
Radiant child

I could never find
Another one like you
Part of me is
Deep down inside you

Can't you feel
The whole world turning
We are real and
We are burning, yeah

Diamond Girl
Now that I've found you
Well, it's about you that I am
Whoa, Whoa, oh

Diamond Girl
You sure do shine
Diamond Girl
You sure do shine
Diamond Girl
You sure do shine
Diamond Girl
You sure do, you sure do
You sure do shine
