Stop searching the sky for answers
And look within
Our greatest gift
Is the life we are given

This is the price you pay
For throwing your whole life away

How can you know yourself
When your world is just a lie

Still I rise!
From the ashes
Look Inside
Search for meaning
Truth cannot survive

I feel the hate inside you
I watch it burn
You heard the warnings
But you, you never learned

This is the price you pay
For throwing your whole life away

How can you know yourself
When your world is just a lie

Still I rise!
From the ashes
Look inside
Search for meaning
Truth will not survive

Watch it burn
The hate inside you
No return
Ignore the warning signs
