As I breathe this cold that confines me
It is I who hopes to bring light
To this valley of death
Behind the shadow of lies

Brilliant beams converge now to blind me
I cannot feel shame nor regret
But in the presence of death
When the vultures arrive

Slaves, your time of descent will come with us all
Pain the way of all flesh that withers to old

All that you dream will be forgotten
And burn with the kindred of souls
I am the seed who has begotten
To rot with the waste of this earth down below
Now burn with the kindred of souls
Your hopes have now aged and withered away

All that you dream will be forgotten
And burn with the kindred of souls
I am the seed who has begotten
To rot with the waste of this earth down below
