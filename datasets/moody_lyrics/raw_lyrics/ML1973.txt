Silent night, let me sleep away these memories within
Sacrifices of purity are turning into sins
And this judgement day is growing near
And this confession is killing me again

This beautiful tragedy is crashing into me
This dying destiny

So now you lay yourself down in this grave with shattered eyes
Beautiful melodies to try and wash away the lies
And this judgement day is growing near
And this confession is killing me again

This beautiful tragedy is crashing into me
This dying destiny, take me away
This beautiful tragedy come crashing into me
This dying destiny

Will you be there?
Will you be there by my grave?
Or will you be the death of me?
My beautiful tragedy

This beautiful tragedy is crashing into me
This dying destiny, take me away
This beautiful tragedy come crashing into me
This dying destiny
