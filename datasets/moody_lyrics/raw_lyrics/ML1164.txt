Baby, my love is deep
Deep as the bottom of the ocean
Pure as the new born baby
Outshines the sun above
That's a pretty good love

Baby, my love will last
Long as life in my body
I swear to you on the Bible
Any old time you say
That's a pretty good love

Baby, please come on home
Wanna put my arms around you
Squeeze you till you're ol' black cold cream
That's the way I feel about you
That's a pretty good love

Ain't nobody love you like I do
Honey, I know just what to do
Ain't much to look at, I won't win a price
When it comes to lovin' I'll open your eyes

Baby, I love you so
You got me beggin' and pleading
Your love is all I need
There's nothin' I wouldn't do
That's a pretty good love

Ain't nobody love you like I do
Honey, I know just what to do
Ain't much to look at, I won't win a price
When it comes to lovin' I'll open your eyes

Baby, I love you so
You got me beggin' and pleading
See, your love is all I need
There's nothin' I wouldn't do
That's a pretty good love

That's a pretty good love
That's a pretty good love
That's a pretty good love
