Met you on a springtime day
You were minding your life
And I was minding mine, too

Lady, when you looked my way
I had a strange sensation
And, darling, that's when I knew

That it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along

Oh, I wake up in the night
And I reached beside me
Hoping you will be there

But instead I find someone
Who believed in me when I said
I'd always care

Oh, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along

So I lived my life in a dream world
For the rest of my days
Just you and me walking hand in hand
In a wishful memory

Oh, I guess that's all
That it would ever be

Wish I had a time machine
I could make myself go back
Until the day I was born

And I would live my life again
And rearrange it so that
I'd be yours from now on

Oh, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along

Oh, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along

Oh, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along

Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else
