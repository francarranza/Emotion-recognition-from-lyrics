Well, I picked out a tree
And I tied it to the car
There's a wreath up on our door
Eight tiny reindeer in the yard

I drove under the downtown lights
Red an' green and blue
The silver neon snowflakes
Only made me think of you

It's Christmas all around me
You're in someone else's land
So I'm sending out my only wish
Hey Santa, tell the man:

Hey mister
Send my baby home
This December
I don't want to be all alone
Oh, Christmas in America
I need you in my arms
Far away from harm
Send my baby home

I hear someone singing "Jingle Bells"
No wait, that's "Deck the Halls"
And the teenagers with candy canes
Ramble through the malls

The girls are down at Ruby's
Trying to find some Christmas cheer
There's not much to do but drink too much
When every day is unclear

So here I am on Christmas Eve
This silent holy night
And I reach up to the stars for you
I pray that you're alright

Hey mister
Send my baby home
This December
I don't want to be all alone
Oh, Christmas in America
I need you in my arms
Far away from harm
Mister, send my baby home

What happened to the peace on Earth?
All that goodwill toward men?
Oh, come on, all ye faithful
It's time to think again

Hey mister
Send my baby home
This December
I don't want to be all alone
Oh, come on, come on, come on
Hey mister
Send my baby home
This December
I don't want to be all alone

Oh, come on, come on

Hey mister
Send my baby home
Oh, this December
I don't want to be all alone

Send my baby home
Send my baby home
Send my baby home
Send my baby home
Come on, send my baby home
Send my baby home
Send my baby home
Send my baby home

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, come on, come on
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Send my baby home
Send my baby home
Come on, send my baby home
Send my baby home
