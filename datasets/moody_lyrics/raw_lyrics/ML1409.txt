I'm just ordinary people
Who found extraordinary love
Sometimes it's hard to believe
That God keeps loving me so much

There are so many people I look up to
Used to tell them I wanna be just like you
Then God took ordinary
And gave me a chance
And everyday I gotta thank him for where I am

I'm just ordinary people
Who found extraordinary love
Sometimes it's hard to believe
That God keeps loving me so much

I looked in the mirror, I saw average
You looked down from heaven, you saw a gift
Still can't figure out why you
Loved me so but that's what makes you God
I'll never know cause

I'm just ordinary people
Who found extraordinary love
Sometimes it's hard to believe
That God keeps loving me so much

Listen to me, I can tell you how it goes
God can take a nobody who no one knows
Make 'em more than you ever could be
Ask me how I know he did it for me
