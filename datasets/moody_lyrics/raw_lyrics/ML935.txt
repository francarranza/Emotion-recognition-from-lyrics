If I could only relive yesterday
I think I'd try to do it right
If I had one more chance to be with you
I think it just might save my life

Just one more chance
And I will be your love forever
One more chance, one more chance
Just one more chance
And I will be your love forever
One more chance, one more chance

I'm caught it the same old world
And I just can't get my head unwhirled
And I'm looking for any old place to hide

I took a journey down through paradise
I think I'd like to make it twice
I took another journey yesterday
I hope it just won't ruin my life

Just one more chance
And I will be your love forever
One more chance, one more chance
Just one more chance
And I will be your love forever
One more chance, One more chance
(Repeat twice)
