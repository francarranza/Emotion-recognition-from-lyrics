Oh no, honey what have you done?
Oh no no, it's the sound of my gun
Oh no, honey, honey what have you done?
Oh no no, it's the sound

Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Her whole world's come undone
From lookin' straight at the sun

What did her daddy do?
What did he put you through?
They say when Janie was arrested
They found him underneath the train
But man, he had it comin'
Now that Janie's got a gun
She ain't never gonna be the same

Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run

Tell me now it's untrue
What did her daddy do?
He jacked a little bitty baby
The man has got to be insane
They say the spell that he was under
The lightning and the thunder
Knew that someone had to stop the rain

Run away, run away from the pain
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away from the pain
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away, run, run away

Janie got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run 

What did her daddy do?
It's Janie's last I.O.U
She had to take him down easy 
And put a bullet in his brain
She said 'cause nobody believes me
The man was such a sleaze, he ain't
Never gonna be the same

Run away, run away from the pain
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away from the pain
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away, run, run away

Janie's got a gun
Janie got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Everybody is on the run

Janie got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run (Honey, honey, what's the problem?)
Because Janie's got a gun (Tell me it ain't right)

Janie's got a gun (Was it daddy's cradle robbin' that)
Her dog day's just begun (Made you scream at night?)
Now everybody is on the run
Janie got a gun

Janie got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run (Honey, honey, what's the problem?)
Because Janie's on the run (Tell me it ain't right)
