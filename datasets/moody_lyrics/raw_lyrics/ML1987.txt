Let your pollen lie on the legs of bees
Through the pines, through the briars
And down to the briny sea
Lit it fall on the fields and the haystacks
On the eye of a flea on a bear's back

So take your earplugs out, hear what the birds have to say
They've been tryin' but they've been tired
And they are tired today
And they're waiting around for a wind
Sick of waiting around for a wind

Up at Lookout Point! And down at Makeout Creek!
Lovers lyin' in the pines!
And off their guards, asleep
And they're waiting around for a sign
Sick of waiting around for a sign

I've been tryin', I've been tied...
I've been tryin'! I've been tried!
