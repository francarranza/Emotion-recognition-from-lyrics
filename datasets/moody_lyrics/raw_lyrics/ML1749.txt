Combing your hair I know nothing about you
Smiling like a young moon
Looking in the mirror

My card knows you could be happy like a child
Raising your arms to me
Waiting to be coming down to me

In your love I swear
In your love I hide
In your love I sleep
In your love I turn
In your love I cry
In my life I ride
I ask you again

Try so hard so that I could sleep without you
And you, you keep holding on to my lonely parts

In your love I swear
In your love I hide
In your love I sleep
In your love I turn
In your love I cry
In my life I ride
I ask you again

Is this love or prison?
Is this love or prison?
This is love
Is this love or prison?
Is this love or prison?
This is love
Is this love or prison?
This is love
Is this love or prison?
This is love
Is this love or prison?
This is love
