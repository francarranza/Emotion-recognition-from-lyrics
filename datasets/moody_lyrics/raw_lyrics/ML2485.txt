Yes God, God don't never change
He's God, always will be God

God in the middle of the ocean
God in the middle of the sea
*The help of the great creator
Truly been a God to me
Hey God, God don't never change
God, always will be God

God in creation
God when Adam fell
God way up in heaven
God way down in hell
He's God, God don't never change
God, always will be God

Spoke to the mountain
Said how great I am
Want you to get up this mornin'
Skip around like a lamb
Well he's God, God don't never change
God, always will be God

God in the time of sickness
God in the doctor too
In the time of the influenza
He truly was a God to you
Well he's God, God don't never change
He's God, always will be God

God in the pulpit
God way down at the door
He's God in the amen corner
God all over the floor
Well he's God, God don't never change
God, always will be God
