My mother told me, 
Some say I won't last, I say they're wrong
And we won't back down this time
No, we won't back down this time

We are unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated
We are unstoppable
No, we don't need a reason
We are unstoppable, wooh

Crawling though the dirt, you heard our prayers
Sticks and stones may hurt, but we don't care
And we won't back down this time 
No, we won't back down this time

We are unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated
We are unstoppable
No, we don't need a reason
We are unstoppable, wooh

Yo, yo-ee-oh-a-yeah, yeah, oh
Yo, yo-ee-oh-a-yeah, yeah, oh
Yo, yo-ee-oh-a-yeah, yeah, oh
Yo, yo-ee-oh-a-yeah, yeah, oh

And we won't back down this time 
No, we won't back down this time

We are unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated
We are unstoppable
No, we don't need a reason

We are unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated
We are unstoppable
No, we don't need a reason
We are unstoppable, wooh
