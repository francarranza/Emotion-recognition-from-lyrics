L is for the way you look at me
O is for the only one I see
V is very very extraordinary
E is even more than anyone that you adore can love

It's all that I can give to you
Love is more than just a game for two
Two in love can make it
Take my heart but please don't break it
Love was made for me and you

Yeah L is for the way you look - you're lookin' at me
And O is for the only one I see
V is so very very extraordinary
Now E is even more than any-any-anyone that you adore can love

It's all that I'm gonna give to you
Oh love is more than just a game for two
Two in love can make it
Take my heart but please don't you break it
'Cause love was made for me and you
I'm a-tellin' you that love was made for me and you
Don't you know that love was made for me and you
