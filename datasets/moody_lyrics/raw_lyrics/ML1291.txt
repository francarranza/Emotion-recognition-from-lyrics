When I look up from my pillow
I dream you are there with me
Though you are far away
I know you'll always be near to me

Yeah, I go to sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep
And imagine that you're there with me

I look around me
And feel you are ever so close to me
Each tear that flows from my eye
Brings back memories of you to me

I go to sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
Yeah, I go to sleep
And imagine that you're there with me

But I was wrong, I will cry
I will love you till the day I die
You alone, you alone and no one else
You were meant for me

When morning comes again
I have the loneliness you left me
Each day drags by
Until finally my time descends on me

I go to sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
