Oh, but all I know, is all I know
It's the disco infiltrator for sure
But all I see, is all I see
But still you want it, oh
Stop, you can't believe, what you believe
Or the disco infiltrator will leave
Oh, stupid me, oh, stupid me
But still we want it, oh

Stop, we can't shake the waist
Oh, stop, you've got to shake the waist

Stop, what you've been told is what you're told
It's the disco infiltrator gone cold
Oh, stupid you, I bet' told the truth
But you don't want it, no
Stop, you make me frown your little town
You run the disco infiltrator on down
Oh, stupid you, oh, stupid me
And we deserve it, oh

Stop, you can shake the waist
Oh, stop, you've got to shake the waist

Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time

Oh, but all I know, is all I know
It's the disco infiltrator for sure
But all I see, is all I see
But still you want it, oh
Stop, you can't believe what you believe
Or the disco infiltrator will leave
Oh, stupid me, oh, stupid me
Oh, but still we want it, oh

Stop, you can't shake your waist
Oh, don't stop, you've got to shake your waist
Stop, you can't shake your waist
Oh, don't stop, you've got to shake your waist

Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
