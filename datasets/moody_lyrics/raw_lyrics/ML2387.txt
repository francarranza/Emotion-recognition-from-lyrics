Got an angel at my bedside
Watchin' over me tonight
Smilin' from a photograph
And everything's just right

And dreamin' of you before
And now it's true
My heart is beatin' just for you
Baby, I wanna know

Is it love, is it love?
Is it why I fall every time you call?
Is it love, really love?
When you say it's forever

Is it love, is it love?
That I'm breathin'
When I dream of you tonight

Tell me how can I imagine
Something brighter than your eyes
No one ever came this close
And made me realize

And dreamin' of you before
And now it's true
My heart is beatin' just for you
Baby, I wanna know

Is it love, is it love?
Is it why I fall every time you call?
Is it love, really love?
When you say it's forever

Is it love, is it love?
That I'm breathin'
When I dream of you tonight

Is it always gonna be?
Will you always care for me?
It's all that I want, all that you need
Is it all I've ever hoped for, baby?

Is it love, is it love?
Is it why I fall every time you call?
Is it love, really love?
When you say it's forever

Is it love, is it love?
Is it why I fall every time you call?
Is it love, really love?
When you say it's forever

Is it love, is it love?
That I'm breathin'
When I dream of you tonight
