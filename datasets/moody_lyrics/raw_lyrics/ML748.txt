Seether is neither loose nor tight
Seether is neither black nor white
I try to keep her on a short leash
I try to calm her down
I try to ram her into the ground, yeah

Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth

Seether is neither big nor small
Seether is the center of it all
I try to rock her in my cradle
I try to knock her out
I try to cram her back in my mouth, yeah

Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth

Keep her down, boiling water
Keep her down, what a lovely daughter
Oh, she is not born like other girls
But I know how to conceive her
Oh, she may not look like other girls
But she's a snarl-toothed seether, seether

Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth

Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth

Yeah
