There's a prophet on a mountain and he's making up dinner with long division and a riding crop
Anybody can feel like a winner when it's served up piping hot
But the people aren't looking for a handout, they're America's working corps
Can this be what they voted for?

Let them eat war, let them eat war
That's how to ration the poor
Let them eat war, let them eat war
There's an urgent need to feed, declining pride

From the force to the union shops, the war economy is making new jobs
But the people who benefit most are breaking bread with their benevolent hosts
Who never stole from the rich to give to the poor, all they ever gave to them was a war
And a foreign enemy to deplore

Let them eat war, let them eat war
That's how to ration the poor
Let them eat war, let them eat war
There's an urgent need to feed, declining pride

We've got to kill 'em and eat 'em before they reach for their checks
Squeeze some blue collars, let them bleed from their necks
Seize a few dollars from the people who sweat
'Cause it's freedom or death and they won't question it

At a job site the boss is god like
Conditioned workhorses park at a stoplight
Seasoned vets with their feet in nets
A stones throw away from a rock fight but not tonight

Feed 'em death, here comes another ration
Feed 'em death, 'cause they're the finest in the nation
Feed 'em death, when there's nothing left to feed them with
When it's freedom or it's death

Let them eat war, let them eat war
That's how to ration the poor
Let them eat war, let them eat war
There's an urgent need to feed
