Here we are like we're going to get war again
Coming hard, come and get a gun, join the gang
With the bang bang and the same song we sang
Coming over and over again

It's peaking up now, getting more like a game
And it feels real like we learn to fake the fame
And there's never more then one truth
But you can always tell your better half

Always tell your better half of the story
It goes well with the better side of your face you show on TV
Give me a good reason why I shouldn't start a revolution
What's in the constitution? Is this illusion that we buy?
U cut the wings and then you say fly
U say the hero is the one that died
But the true hero is the one who doesn't live a lie and understands
That there's an end out of the cycle
Who's the master? Who's the disciple?
U can do what you can, but will you do it again?
So what's the plan?
Looks like we are going to get war again

Here we are like we're going to get war again
Coming hard, come and get a gun, join the gang
With the bang bang and the same song we sang
Coming over and over again

It's peaking up now, getting more like a game

And it feels real like we learn to fake the fame
And there's never more then one truth
But you can always tell your better half

Look out
Going to get war again, going to get wrong again
Gone again, with the same song again, on again
Can't be born again, who's gone again?
Who's going to gain out of this war again?
Hooligan in a tie rule again
Soon again you will see it all begin again
Sink again, and that will make you think again

And when they call you go
When they are wrong you know
And you will fallow, and you will swallow
Again like long ago the bomb will blow
So sit back relax and enjoy the show
'Cause you are as cold as snow and I am here below
I'm going to speak out, scream out
Here we go, got the fresh flow
So before it's over
Then you are going to find a different kind of war to start again

Going to get war again
