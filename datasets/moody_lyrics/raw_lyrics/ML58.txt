Shriek the lips
Across a ragged tongue
Convulsing together
Sing violently
Move the jaw
Cry out loud
Bound up the dead
Triumphantly

The ragged, they come
And the ragged, they kill
You pray so hard on bloody knees
The ragged, they come
And the ragged, they kill
Down in the cool air, I can see

Hey, yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah, I'm your superbeast
Hey, yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah, I'm your superbeast

Stir the limbs across the wrist
Full possession of memory
Bury me as a dog
Icy hands surrounding me

The ragged, they come
And the ragged, they kill
You pray so hard on bloody knees
The ragged, they come
And the ragged, they kill
Down in the cool air, I can see

Hey, yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah, I'm your superbeast
Hey, yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah, I'm your superbeast

Shriek the lips
Across a ragged tongue
Convulsing together
Sing violently
Move the jaw
Cry out loud
Bound up the dead
Triumphantly

The ragged, they come
And the ragged, they kill
You pray so hard on bloody knees
The ragged, they come
And the ragged, they kill
Down in the cool air, I can see

Hey, yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah, I'm your superbeast
Hey, yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah, I'm your superbeast
