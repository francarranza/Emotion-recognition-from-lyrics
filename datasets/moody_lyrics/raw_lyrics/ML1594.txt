Do you want to be a poet and write...
Do you want to be an actor up in lights
Do you wanna be a solider -- and fight for love
Do you want to travel the world
Do you wanna be a diver for pearls
Or climb a mountain and touch the clouds above
Be anyone you want to be
Bring to life your fantasies
I want something in return

I want you to burn
Burn for me baby, like a candle in my night
Burn, burn for me
Burn for me

Are you gonna to be a gambler and deal
Are you gonna to be a doctor and heal
Or go to heaven and touch God's face
Are you gonna be a dreamer who sleeps
Are you gonna be a sinner who weeps
Or an angel under grace

I'll lay down on your bed of coals
Offer up my heart and soul
But In return

Oh,
I want you to burn baby
Oh
Laugh for me, cry for me
Pray for me, fly for me
Live for me, die for us

I want you to burn
Burn for me baby, like a candle in my night
Oh burn, burn for me
Burn for me

I want you to burn
I want you to burn, for me baby
Burn for me

I want you to burn
I want you to burn, for me baby
