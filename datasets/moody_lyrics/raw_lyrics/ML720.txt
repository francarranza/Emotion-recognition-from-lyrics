I drove for miles just to find you
And find myself
All these screams
All these voices in my head
You gave me strength
Gave me hope
For a lifetime
I never was satisfied

This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin' up
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin' up

It's not your fault
I'm a bitch
I'm a monster
Yes I'm a beast

And I feast when I conquer
But I'm alone
On my throne
All these riches
I came this way
All this way
Just to say

This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin' up
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin' up

I'm givin' up baby
Yes
I'm givin' up baby


(Feels like I've been driving for miles and I can't seem to silence these voices in my head. Who'll save me?)

This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin' up
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin' up
