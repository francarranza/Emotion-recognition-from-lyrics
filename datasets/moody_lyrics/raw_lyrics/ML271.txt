Wonderful, So wonderful
Is your unfailing love
Your cross has spoken mercy over me
No eye has seen no ear has heard
No heart could fully know
How glorious, how beautiful you are

Beautiful one I love
Beautiful one I adore
Beautiful one my soul must sing

Powerful so powerful
Your glory fills the skies
The mighty works displayed for all to see
The beauty of your majesty awakes my heart to sing
How marvelous how wonderful you are

You opened my eyes to your wonders anew
You captured my heart with this love
Because nothing on eatrh is as beautiful as you
