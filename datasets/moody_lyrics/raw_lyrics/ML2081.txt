Let me rock you to sleep, pretty baby
Let me rock you to sleep, pretty girl
When I look down at you
I see all I need to see, to be a man
I feel all I need to feel, I understand

So let me rock you to sleep
Let me rock you to sleep,

Pretty baby,
Let me rock you, let me rock you,
Let rock you let me rock you to sleep oh

And I feel deep inside, all I got to do
To protect you from the night
And every evil they do

So let me rock you to sleep, pretty baby
So let me rock you to sleep, pretty girl
Let me rock you to sleep
Let me rock you rock you
Let me rock you,
Let me rock you
Let me rock you to sleep yeah
My baby, my baby
My baby, my baby
