I'm a dick thrower
Her neck and her back hurting
Cut throat I'll have you like a brand new version
It's like when she get used to it then you start serving
Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jicky jerking

Slow down for me you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping, I'm trying to grip that ass
Keep being hard headed and Ima make you get off me
Got human up the skies but my face is a doggy

If you loving my bark let me bury my bone
I got 4 or 5 bad married bitches at home
One of my bitches fell in love with that outside dick

She love the way the dick stay hard from 12 till early in the morn
Fine bitches if you listening you heard me I'm strong

If you going through your cycle, I ain't with It I'm gone
You must have heard about them hoes that I beat up in my home
They wasn't telling the truth baby you know they was wrong
Na, make it official where's some of that dome

I don't mind buying to, your riding to
Don't be asking nigga questions about where I'm driving you
Lil mama my shit together I ain't jiving you
I don't think that nigga could do you better than I could do, ya know

And juvenile from courtless street by derby
Same nigga that used to be running with Rusty and Kirby
Can a playa from the n.o.ya get a chance with it
But I can't bounce with you without using my hands with it

Slow motion for me, slow motion for me

Slow motion, she open, I'm hoping that she don't leave my dick broken
With brush, burns and swollen
I'm toting she wanted me to make a outer believer
I gurantee ya ima see ya when I see ya

And just don't holla out my name like we was all that
Your pussy throw back and you know that
So stop stunting slow motion for a real nigga
I'm going off that incredible potion and I'mma deal with ya

I like how that Victoria Secret sit in that ass
Let me pour some more hip and Hennesey in your glass
Would I be violating if I grab me a handfull
Im knowing what's happening all I want is a sample

Who you wit I'm in the rental today
It's going down and happening and I remember the way
Less money we spend on bullshit the more for the weed
What's it gonna take for you to come slow motion with me, like
