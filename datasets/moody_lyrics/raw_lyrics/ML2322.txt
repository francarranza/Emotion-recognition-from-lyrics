Well...
You're gonna need somebody on your bond
You're gonna need somebody on your bond
Lord, Just wait in the midnight when death comes
Slippin' in your room
You're gonna need, ah, somebody on your bond

I heard the voice of Jesus saying Come unto me and rest
Down the weary one lay down thy head and rest

You're gonna need somebody on your bond
You're gonna need somebody on your bond
Lord, 'ust wait in the midnight when death comes
Slippin' in your room
You're gonna need, ah, somebody on your bond

When you was a gambler, nobody would go your bond
Fell on your knees and began to pray, 'Called Jesus to
Go your bond.'

You're gonna need somebody on your bond
You're gonna need somebody on your bond
Lord, Just wait in the midnight when death comes
Slippin' in your room
You're gonna need, ah, somebody on your bond

I came to Jesus as I was, weary and wounded and sad
Found in Him a resting place and he has made me glad

I've got somebody on my bond
Lord, I've got somebody on my bond
Lord, Just wait in the midnight when death comes
Slippin' in your room
Lord, I've got somebody on my bond
