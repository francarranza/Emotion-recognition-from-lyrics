Lie lie lie lie liar you lie
Lie lie lie lie tell me why tell me why
Why d'you have to lie
Should've realised that you should've told the truth
Should've realised you know what I'll do

You're in suspension
You're a liar

Now I wanna know know know know
I wanna know why you never look me in the face
Broke a confidence just to please your ego
Should've realised you know what I know

You're in suspension
You're a liar

I know where you go everybody you know
I know everything that you do or say
So when you tell lies I'll always be in your way
I'm nobody's fool and I know more 'cause I know
What I know

You're in suspension
You're a liar
You're a liar
You're a liar
A lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie

Lie lie lie lie
Liar you lie lie lie lie lie
I think you're funny
You're funny
Ha-ha

I don't need it, don't need your blah blah
Should've realised I don't know what you are

You're in suspension
You're in suspension
You're in suspension
You're a liar
You're a liar
You're a lie lie

Lie
