Inseparable
That's how we'll always be
Inseparable
Just you and me
It's so wonderful
To know you'll always be around me

Incredible
What you are to me
Incredible
You bring out the woman in me
With your style of love
Inseparable
Yes we are

We're like a flower to a tree
Like words to a melody of love
There's no way we could break up
No words that could make us blow our thing
We are just~

Inseparable
That's how it is
Inseparable
For the rest of our years
It's so wonderful
To know you'll always be around
