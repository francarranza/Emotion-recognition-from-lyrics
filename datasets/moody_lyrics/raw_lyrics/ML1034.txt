Blood, sugar, suckerfish in my dish
How many pieces do you wish?
Step into a heaven where I keep it on the soul side
Girl, please me, be my soul bride

Every woman has a piece of Aphrodite
Copulate to create, a state of sexual light
Kissing her virginity, my affinity
I mingle with the gods, I mingle with divinity

Blood sugar baby
She's magik, sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby
She's magik, sex magik, sex magik

Blood sugar crazy
She has it, sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby
She's magik, sex magik, sex magik

Glorious euphoria is my must
Erotic shock is a function of lust
Temporarily blind, dimension to discover
In time, each into the other

Uncontrollable notes from her snow white throat
Fill a space in which two bodies float
Operatic by voice, a fanatic by choice
Aromatic is the flower, she must be moist

Blood sugar baby
She's magik, sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby
She's magik, sex magik, sex magik

Blood sugar crazy
She has it, sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby
She's magik, sex magik, sex magik

Blood sugar baby
She magik, sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby
She magik, sex magik, sex magik

Blood sugar crazy
She has it, sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby
She magik, sex magik, sex magik

Blood sugar, my girl
She magik, sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby
She magik, sex magik, sex magik

Blood sugar crazy
She has it, sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby
She magik, sex magik, sex magik
