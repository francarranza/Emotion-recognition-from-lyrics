I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
They won't mean a think, if you're not here with me

I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue blue blue Christmas

You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue blue blue Christmas
But I'll have a blue, blue blue blue Christmas
But I'll have a blue, blue blue blue Christmas
