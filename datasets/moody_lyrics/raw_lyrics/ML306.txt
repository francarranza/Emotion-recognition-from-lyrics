Loving you so
I was to blind to see
You letting me go
But now that you've set me free

It's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you

Oh, didn't you know
It wouldn't be so easy
(Doo-wop)
You lettin' me go
You can be sure that now

It's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you

Oh, tho' I know I can't forget about you
I'm gonna try to show how much
You're turning me around, destroying me
I'll never be the same anymore

You must realize
You took your love and left me
(Doo-wop)
Quite by surprise
You can be sure that now

It's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you

Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you

(Gonna take a miracle)
Ooh, baby
(Gonna take a miracle)
Uh-huh
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you

(Gonna take a miracle)
Uh-huh
(Gonna take a miracle)
(To make me love someone new)
Ooh, baby
('Cause I'm crazy for you)

Baby, yes, it's gonna take a miracle
Yes a miracle
(Gonna take a miracle)
Ooh, baby
(To make me love someone new)
('Cause I'm crazy for you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, baby

(Gonna take a miracle)
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy, crazy
Crazy about you, boy, yeah...
