Joan was quizzical, 
Studied pataphysical science in the home 
Late nights all alone with a test tube 
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine 
Calls her on the phone 
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Jo-oh-oh-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go 
A knock comes on the door 

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head 
Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure she was dead 

Back in school again
Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed 
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene 
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away 
So he waits behind 
Writing fifty times "I must not be so, oh-oh, oh"
But when she turns her back on the boy 
He creeps up from behind 

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head (do-do do-doo-doo)
Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead 

(Do-do do-doo-doo)

P.C. 31 said "We've caught a dirty one"
Maxwell stands alone 
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh-oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free ("Maxwell must go free")
The judge does not agree, and he tells them so, oh-oh, oh
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind 

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head (do-do do-doo-doo)
Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead 
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh

(Do-do do-doo-doo)

Silver hammer man
