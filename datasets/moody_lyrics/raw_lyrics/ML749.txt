I'm feelin'...
I wanna love you, I want to love and treat you right;
I wanna love you every day and every night:
We'll be together, with a roof over our heads;
To share the shelter in a single bed;
Is this love - is this love - is this love -
Is this love that I'm feelin'?
Is this love - is this love - is this love -
Is this love that I'm feelin'? Wo-o-o-oah!
I wanna know - wanna know - wanna know now!
I wanna know - wanna know - wanna know now!

I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I - I'm willing and able,
So I lay my cards on your table!
I wanna love you - I wanna love, love and treat - love and treat you right;

I wanna love you every day and every night:

We'll be together, with a roof over our heads;
We'll share the shelter, of my single bed;
We'll share the same room, yeah! - for Jah provide the bread.

Is this love - is this love - is this love -
Is this love that I'm feelin'?
Is this love - is this love - is this love -
Is this love that I'm feelin'? Wo-o-o-oh!
Is this love - is this love - is this love -
Is this love that I'm feelin'?
Tell me, if its love, love, love that I'm feelin'?
I wanna love you - I wanna love, love and treat - love and treat you right;
Is this love - is this love - is this love -
Is this love that I'm feelin'?
Someone tell me if its love, love ... [Fade out]
