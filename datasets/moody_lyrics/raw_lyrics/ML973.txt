I'm sitting in the railway station, got a ticket for my destination, mm
On a tour of one-night stands, my suitcase and guitar in hand
And every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escapin'
Home where my music's playin'
Home where my love lies waitin' silently for me

Every day's an endless stream of cigarettes and magazines, mm
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escapin'
Home where my music's playin'
Home where my love lies waitin' silently for me

Tonight I'll sing my songs again, I'll play the game and pretend, mm-mm
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony, I need someone to comfort me
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escapin'
Home where my music's playin'
Home where my love lies waitin' silently for me
Silently for me
