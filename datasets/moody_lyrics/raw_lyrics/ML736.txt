[Jade]
Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my Ma and Pa
But not the way that I do love you

[Alex]
Well, holy moly, me oh my
You're the apple of my eye
Girl, I've never loved one like you

[Jade]
Man, oh man, you're my best friend
I scream it to the nothingness
There ain't nothin' that I need

[Alex]
Well, hot and heavy pumpkin pie
Chocolate candy, Jesus Christ
There ain't nothin' please me more than you

[All]
Oh home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you

[Jade & Alex]
Lalalala, take me home
Momma, I'm coming home

[Alex]
I'll follow you into the park
Through the jungle, through the dark
Girl, I've never loved one like you

[Jade (Alex)]
Moats and boats, and waterfalls
Alleyways and payphone calls
I've been everywhere with you 

[Alex (Jade)]
Laugh until we think we'll die 
Barefoot on a summer night 
Never could be sweeter than with you

[Jade]
And in the streets we're running free
Like it's only you and me

[Jade & Alex]
Geez, you're somethin' to see

[All]
Oh home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you

[Jade & Alex]
Lalalala, take me home
Daddy, I'm coming home

[Jade & Alex]
"Jade..."
"Alexander..."
"Do you remember that day you fell out of my window?"
"I sure do, you came jumping out after me."
"Well, you fell out in the concrete and nearly broke your ass.
And you were bleeding all over the place and I rushed you off to the hospital.
Do you remember that?"
"Yes, I do."
"Well, there's something I never told you about that night."
"What didn't you tell me?"
"While you were sitting in the backseat, smoking a cigarette you thought was gonna be your last,
I was falling deep, deeply in love with you, and I never told you till just now!"
"Aw..."

[All]
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh home, let me come home
Home is when I'm alone with you!

[Alex]
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you

[Jade]
Home, yes I am home
Home is when I'm alone with you

[Jade]
Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my Ma and Pa.
Moats and boats and waterfalls
Alleyways and payphone calls

Home is wherever I'm with you
Home is when I'm alone with you
