Here I am again
I feel time is draggin' on
Aren't you getting tired of me?
Whinging, overdrawn

Faceless, blind
Want to take her out again
She's not just mine
Want to take her out again

In a bodiless embrace
Thriving, I have grown
Fickle. changing grip, replaced
Choking, take it all

Faceless, blind
Want to take her out again
She's not just mine
Want to take her out again

Dedicated, true to form
Still the only one
Only guarantee
Continue after I am done

Faceless, blind
Want to take her out again
She's not just mine
Want to take her out again
