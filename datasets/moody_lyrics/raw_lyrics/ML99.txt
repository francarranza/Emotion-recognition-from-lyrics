In the shuffling madness of the locomotive breath
Runs the all-time loser headlong to his death
Oh, he feels the pistons scraping
Steam breaking on his brow
Old Charlie stole the handle
And the train, it won't stop going
No way to slow down

He sees his children jumpin' off at stations, one by one
His woman and his best friend in bed and having fun
Oh, he's crawling down the corridor
On his hands and knees
Old Charlie stole the handle
And the train, it won't stop going
No way to slow down

He hears the silence howling, catches angels as they fall
And the all time winner has got him by the balls
Oh, he picks up Gideon's Bible
Open at page one
I thank God, he stole the handle
And the train, it won't stop going
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
