Got to be there, got to be there 
In the morning 
When she says hello to the world 
Got to be there, got to be there 
Bring her good times 
And show her that she's my girl 
Oh what a feeling there'll be 
The moment I know she loves me 
'Cause when I look in her eyes I realize 
I need her sharing her world beside me 

So I've got to be there 
Got to be there in the morning 
And welcome her into my world 
And show her that she is my girl 
When she says, "Hello world!" 
I need her sharing the world beside me 

That's why I've got to be there 
Got to be there where love begins 
And that's everywhere she goes 
I've got to be there so she knows 
That when she's with me, she's home 

Got to be there 
Got to be there
