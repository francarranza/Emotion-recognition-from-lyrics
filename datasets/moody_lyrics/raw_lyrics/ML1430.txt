I must have rehearsed my lines a thousand times
Until I had them memorized
But when I get up the nerve to tell you the words
Just never seem to come out right

If only you knew how much I do
I do love you
If only you knew how much I do
I do need you

I dreamed of moments we share but you're not there
I'm living in a fantasy
'Cause you don't even suspect, could probably care less
About the changes I've been going through

If only you knew how much I do
I do love you
If only you knew how much I do
I do need you

If only you knew how much I do
I do love you
If only you knew how much I do
I do need you

If only you knew how much I do
I do love you
If only you knew how much I do
I do love you

If only you knew just how much I do
Do love you
If only you knew just how much I do
Do love you

If only you knew
I do love you
If only you knew
I do love you

If only you knew just how much I do
Do love you
