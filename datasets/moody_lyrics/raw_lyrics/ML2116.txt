Huh!

There is no love
No Love

Huh!

I am a duplication
Innocently
I was conceived
So violently

There was no love
There was no love for me
There was only hatred

I am rape
I am hate
I am rape
I am hate

Every day I feel anonymous hate
Forever in the shadow of disgrace

I am rape
I am hate
I am rape
I am hate

Filled with pain
A bruised and darkened soul
Spare me from the

Life that's full of misery
I don't want to live that way
I don't want to live that way

There is no love

Huh!

Every day I feel anonymous hate
Forever in the shadow of disgrace

I am rape
I am hate
I am rape
I am hate

Filled with pain
A bruised and darkened soul
Spare me from the
Life that's full of misery

I am so
Filled with pain
A bruised and darkened soul
Spare me from the
Life that's full of misery

I don't want to live that way
I don't want to live that way
I don't want to live that way
I don't want to live that way

I am so
Filled with pain
A bruised and darkened soul
Spare me from the
Life that's full of misery

Spare me from the
Life that's full of pain
Spare me from the
Life that's full of pain
I don't want to live that way
I don't want to live that way
I don't want to live that way
I don't want to live that way
I don't want to live that way
I don't want to live that way
