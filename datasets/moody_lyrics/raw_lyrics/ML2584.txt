Well, be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula, I don't mean maybe

Be-bop-a-lula
She's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll

Well she's the girl in the red blue jeans
She's the queen of all the teens
She's the one woman that I know
She's the woman that loves me so

Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula
She's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll

Let's rock!

Well now she's the one that's got that beat
She's the one with the flyin' feet
She's the one that bops around the store
She's the one that gives more more more more

Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula
She's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll

Let's rock again now!

Well, be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula, I don't mean maybe

Be-bop-a-lula
She's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll
