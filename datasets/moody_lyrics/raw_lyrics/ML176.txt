All the tension in the world today
All the little girls fillin' up the world today
When the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good
But I'ma live my life like I should (like I should)

Now all the critics wanna hit it
This hit, can how we did it
Just because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted, new era committed
Now this red cap gets a rap from his critics

Do we always gotta cry (always gotta cry)?
Do we always gotta live inside a lie (live inside a lie)?
Life's just a blast, it's moving really fast
You better stay on top, or life will kick you in the ass

Follow me into a solo
Remember that, kid - so, what you wanna do?
And where you gonna run when your starin' down the cable of a-
A mic pointed at your grill like a gun?
Limp Bizkit is rockin' the set
It's like Russian Roulette when you're placin' your bet
So don't be upset when you're broke and your done
'Cause I'ma be the one till I jet
(I'ma be the one till I jet)

I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately
I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
Now I know why you want to hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately

Now you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
Now you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

Does anybody really know the secret
Or the combination for this life and where they keep it?
It's kinda sad when you don't know the meaning
But everything happens for a reason
(Everything happens for a reason)
I don't even know what I should say
'Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, a microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beatin' on my mind every second with my fist

Everybody wanna run (wanna run)
Everybody wanna hide from the gun (from the gun)
You can take a ride through this life, if you want
But you can't take that edge off that knife (no, sir)
And now you want your money back (money back)
But you're denied 'cause your brains fried from the sack
And there ain't nothing I can do
'Cause life is a lesson - you learn it when you're through

I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately
I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
Now I know why you want to hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately

Now you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately
Now you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately

Now I know why...
Now I know why...
Now I know why...
Now I know why...

Now I know why you wanna hate me
Now I know why you wanna hate me
Now I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!
