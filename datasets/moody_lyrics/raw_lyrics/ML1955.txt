As I lay here next to you
Holding you in my arms, baby
I get a thought here in my mind
It says, "Take your time"

I don't wanna move too fast, I don't wanna move too fast
So if I'm gonna be yours and you're gonna be mine
If I'm gonna be yours and you're gonna be mine
We gotta take our time and do it

Easy, easy, got to take it easy
Easy, easy, got to take it easy

Ooh, this feelin' is cool
But I can't get too excited, no
'Cause if I move too fast
See, if it just wanna last, no, no

I don't wanna move too fast, I don't wanna move too fast
So if I'm gonna be yours and you're gonna be mine
If I'm gonna be yours and you're gonna be mine
We gotta take our time and do it

Easy, easy, got to take it easy
Easy, easy, got to take it easy

Ooh, baby, let's go, let's go
So if I'm gonna be yours and you're gonna be mine
If I'm gonna be yours and you're gonna be mine
We gotta take our time and do it

Easy, easy, got to take it easy
Easy, easy, got to take it easy
Easy, easy, got to take it easy
Easy, easy, got to take it easy

God knows this feelin' is good, it's good
And I want this good thing to last, it's good
Ever, ever

Easy, easy, easy, got to take it easy
Easy, easy, got to take it easy
Easy, easy, got to take it easy

Easy, easy, got to take it easy
Easy, easy, got to take it easy
Easy, easy, got to take it easy
