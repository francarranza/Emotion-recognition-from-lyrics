You ask me what would happen if all strangers turned to stone
I'll tell you what might happen if we could always be alone
Alone

Time out, is it time out? I'll take my best guess
'Cause I'm out if I'm in doubt, unless you contest

There's two kinds of love
And one we used to know
There's two kinds of love
And one we used to know

I know I know I know

There's two kinds of love
And one we used to know
There's two kinds of love
And one we used to know
There's two kinds of love
And one we used to know
She says
There's two kinds of love
And one we used to know
