The reason why I stand
The answer lies in You
You hung to make me strong though my praise was few
When I fall I bring Your name down
But I have found in You a heart that bleeds forgiveness
Replacing all these thoughts of painful memories
But I know that Your response will always be

I'll take You back always, yeah
Even when your fight is over now
Even when your fight is over now
I'll take you back always, yeah
Even when the pain is coming through
Even when the pain is coming through
I'll take you back

You satisfy this cry of what I'm looking for
And I'll take all I can and lay it down before
The throne of endless grace now that radiates what's true
I'm in the only place that erases all these faults that have overtaken me but I know That your response will always be

I'll take You back always, yeah
Even when your fight is over now
Even when your fight is over now
I'll take you back always, yeah
Even when the pain is coming through
Even when the pain is coming through
I'll take you back

I can only speak with a grateful heart as I'm pierced by this gift of Your love
I will always bring an offering I can never thank You enough

You take me back always, yeah, even when my fight is over now
Even when my fight is over now
You take me back always, yeah, even When my pain is coming through
Even when my pain is coming through
You take me back, always

Even when my fight is over now
Even when my fight is over now
You'll take me back always
Even when my pain is coming through
Even when my pain is coming through
You'll take me back
