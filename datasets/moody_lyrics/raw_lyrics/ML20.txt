Life can be so fair
Let it go on and on
I can push for good
You got that cherry bomb
Blow out that cherry bomb for me
We lost it long ago
You and me

Now you know your way back from the spirit far
Brush your teeth for bed
Blow out that cherry bomb
Blow out that cherry bomb for me
You got to know it's on your sleeve
Know it's on your sleeve
Know it's on your sleeve

It was the longest day that I had ever known
I watched you start that drive alone
Blow out that cherry bomb for me
It's gonna burn right up your sleeve
Burn right up your sleeve

So there you go again
Out in your dressing gown
Get yourself to bed
Blow out that cherry bomb

Oh, life could be so fair
Let it go on and on
I could pay to have all your cherry bomb
Oh, life could be so fair
Let it go on and on
I could pay to have all your cherry bomb
