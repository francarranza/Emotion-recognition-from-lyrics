Cold fire, it's a cold fire
It's a cold fire, it's a cold fire

It was long after midnight
When we got to unconditional love
She said sure my heart is boundless
But don't push my limits too far

I said if love is so transcendent
I don't understand these boundaries
She said just don't disappoint me
You know how complex women are

I'll be around 
If you don't let me down too far
I'll be around
If you don't let me down

It was just before sunrise
When we started on traditional roles
She said sure I'll be your partner
But don't make too many demands

I said if love has these conditions
I don't understand those songs you love 
She said this is not a love song
This isn't fantasy land

Don't go too far
The phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea
Is a cold fire
Don't cross the line
The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor
Is a cold fire
Don't let me down
The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond
Is a cold fire
Don't break the spell
The look in your eyes as you head for the door 
Is a cold fire

I'll be around
If you don't push me down too far
I'll be around 
If you don't push me down

I'll be around
If you don't push me down to far
I'll be around
If you don't push me down

Don't go too far
The phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea
Is a cold fire
Don't cross the line
The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor
Is a cold fire
Don't let me down
The flame at the heart of a pawnbrokers diamond
Is a cold fire
Don't break the spell
The look in your eyes as you head for the door 
Is a cold fire

I'll be around 
If you don't let me down too far
I'll be around
If you don't let me down

I'll be around
If you don't push me down to far
I'll be around
If you don't push me down
I'll be around
If you don't let me down

It's a cold fire
Love is blind if you are gentle
It's a cold fire
It's a cold fire
Love can turn to a long cold burn
