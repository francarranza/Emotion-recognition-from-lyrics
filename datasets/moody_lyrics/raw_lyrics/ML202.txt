I see trees of green red roses too
I see them bloom for me and for you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed days dark sacred nights
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands sayin', "How do you do"
They're really sayin', "I love you"

I hear babies cry I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll never know
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world
