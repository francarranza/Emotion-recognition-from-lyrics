Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocents

And I will pray for her
I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her
If I could only see her now

Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge

Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
You know, you know

The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on

Circle of fire, my baptism of joy at an end, it seems
The seventh lamb slain
The book of life opens before me

And I will pray for you
Some day I may return
Don't you cry for me
Beyond is where I learn

Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
You know, you know

The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on

Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
You know, you know

The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on

The evil
The evil
The evil that men do
The evil
The evil
The evil that men do
