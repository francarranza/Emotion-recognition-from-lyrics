Since you been gone
I feel my life slipping away
I look to the sky
And everything is turnin' grey
All I made was one mistake
How much more will I have to pay
Why can't you think it over
Why can't you forget about the past

When love makes this sound baby
A heart needs a second chance
Don't put me down babe
Can't you see I love you
Since you've been gone I've been in a trance
This heart needs a second chance
Don't say it's over I just can't say goodbye

So this is love
Standing in the pouring rain
I fooled on you
But she never meant a thing
And I know I ain't got no right
To ask you to sympathize
But why can't you think it over
Why can't you forget about the past

When love makes this sound baby
A heart needs a second chance
Don't put me down baby
Can't you see I love you
Since you been gone I've been in a trance
This heart needs a second chance
Don't say it's over I just can't say goodbye

I never loved her
I never needed her
She was willing and that's all there is to say
Don't forsake me
Please don't leave me now
A heart needs a second chance

Yeah you've been gone and I've been in a trance
This heart needs a second chance
Don't say it's over I just can't say goodbye
Please forgive me and forget it
I was wrong and I admit it
Why can't we talk it over
Why can't we forget about, forget about the past

(A heart needs a second chance)
When love makes this sound baby
(A heart needs a second chance)
Don't put me down babe
You've been gone I've been in a trance
This heart needs a second chance
Don't say it's over I just can't say goodbye

(A heart needs a second chance)
When love makes this sound babe
(A heart needs a second chance)
(A heart needs a second chance)
When love makes this sound baby
(A heart needs a second chance)
