Has it been a day or a week?
As my eyes begin to close
I am walking in my sleep
Living in a state inbetween
Do the signs begin to show
See the eyes fare in the dark
As they glow

These dreams under my pillow
In the twilight of these white nights
These dreams under my pillow 
In the twilight of these white nights
Of these white nights

Something is about to be born
There's a restlessness in me
Keeps me up until the dawn
There is no silence

I will keep following the sirens
There is no silence
I will keep following the sirens

These dreams under my pillow
In the twilight of these white nights
These dreams under my pillow 
In the twilight of these white nights
Of these white nights

These dreams under my pillow
In the twilight of these white nights
These dreams under my pillow 
In the twilight of these white nights
Of these white nights
