In the middle of my life I had nothing to lose
No one to love now it's you I'm thinking of
You're a little of heaven to me
You're all I need it's my concern
There's a lesson to be learned
I thought I had the whole world at my feet
Now I know
That I was dreaming
I fooled around and lost the only one made for me
And now I'm sorry, oh so sorry

Loving you isn't worth the pain of losing you
Losing you isn't worth the pain of loving you
Loving you isn't worth the pain of losing, losing your love

You can label a man worth having it's up to me

This heart of mine has to live a second time
Take a little of your love from me
And I'll be gone
You're love to me is like honey to a bee
I stand accused of being what I am
I'm a fool and now I know it
This episode is ready to unfold
How can I begin to write a brand new story

Loving you isn't worth the pain of losing you
Losing you isn't worth the pain of loving you
Oh loving you isn't worth the pain of losing you
Losing you isn't worth the pain of loving you
Don't wanna lose you
Oh I
