Were you there when they crucified my Lord
Oh were you there when they crucified my Lord
(Ooh sometimes it causes me to tremble) tremble
Were you there when they crucified my Lord
Were you there when they nailed him to the cross
Were you there when they nailed him to the cross
(Ooh sometimes it causes me to tremble) tremble
Were you there when they nailed him to the cross
(Ac.guitar)
(Were you there when they laid him in the tomb
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb
Ooh sometimes it causes me to tremble) tremble
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb
Well were you there when the stone was rolled away
Were you there when the stone was rolled away
(Ooh sometimes it causes me to tremble) tremble
Were you there when the stone was rolled away
