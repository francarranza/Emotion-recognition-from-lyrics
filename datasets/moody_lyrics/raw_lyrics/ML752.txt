Surely you can sit down for a while
Maybe you can even smile
And I'll try to pretend that you love me again
But it might take me a little while
I know you'll be holding me tight
You'll know when the moment is right
When I was broken in two it was all because of you
But baby I need you tonight

It ain't easy being easy
Oh no
You're the one who took my heart and my soul
You walk away and left me out of control
It ain't easy being easy
Oh no

(No it ain't)
Easy when you're needing someone
It ain't easy being under the gun
But I'll surrender even though I should run
It ain't easy being easy

It ain't easy being easy
Ooh
It ain't easy being easy.

I might end up lonely again
But once you were my only friend
So I'll hold you and cry with the truth in my eyes
Hoping you'll love me again.

It ain't easy being easy
Oh no
You're the one who took my heart and my soul
You walk away and left me out of control
It ain't easy being easy
Oh no
