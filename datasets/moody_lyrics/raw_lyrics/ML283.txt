Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with love for me
And I will open up my heart
And let the healer set me free
I'm happy to be in the truth
And I will daily lift my hands
For I will always sing
Of when your love came down

I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever

Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with love for me
And I will open up my heart
And let the healer set me free
I'm happy to be in the truth
And I will daily lift my hands
For I will always sing
Of when your love came down

I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever

Oh, I feel like dancing
It's foolishness, I know
But when the world has seen the light
They will dance with joy
Like we're dancing now

I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I lift my hands and praise your holy name
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever







Sing with me

Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with love for me
And I will open up my heart
And let the healer set me free

I'm happy to be in the truth
And I will daily lift my hands
For I will always sing
Of when Your love came down

I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love, love, oh

Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with love for me
