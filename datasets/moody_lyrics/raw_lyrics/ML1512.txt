There's cracks in the structure I swear baby get out
Tire tracks in the basement to what you might fall

You didn't try cashin' in
That's not my fault

Where are the beggars when I need to look good?
I sure don't want my life as a stroller
And I wouldn't put my life in the hands of a stranger

When you panic
Do you count to ten
When you're surrounded
Do you hold your breath

When you panic
Do you count to ten
When you're surrounded
Do you hold your breath

I sure don't want my life as a stroller
And I wouldn't put my life in the hands of a stranger

When you panic
Do you count to ten
When you're surrounded
Do you hold your breath

When you panic
Do you count to ten
When you're surrounded
Do you hold your breath
