It's so sad, livin' at home
Far from the city and the midnight fun
It's so bad, goin' to school
So far from me and the dirty things that we've done

I'm the King of the Night Time World
And you're my Midnight Queen
I'm the King of the Night Time World
Come live your secret dream

It's so fine, lovin' with ease
Far from the house and the family fights
It's so fine, bein' with you
Bein' with me makes everything all right

I'm the King of the Night Time World
And you're my Midnight Queen
I'm the King of the Night Time World
Come live your secret dream

It's so sad, you're not content
Far from the music and the neon glow
Ain't you glad we got the time
Far from our folks, they'll never ever know

I'm the King of the Night Time World
And you're my Midnight Queen
I'm the King of the Night Time World
Come live your secret dream

I'm the King, I'm the King
I'm the King, I'm the King
I'm the King, I'm the King
I'm the King, I'm the King

I'm the King of the Night Time World
And you're my Midnight Queen
I'm the King of the Night Time World
Come live your secret dream

I'm the King of the Night Time World
And you're my Midnight Queen
I'm the King of the Night Time World
Come live your secret dream

I'm the King of the Night Time World
And you're my Midnight Queen
I'm the King of the Night Time World
Come live your secret dream

I'm the King of the Night Time World
