I know where I'm going
I must be a mile asleep
This destination that I felt all my life is
Movin' me on, movin' me on

I know why I'm going
I see it in my sleep
Insinuation of a diamond place by visions of you

Bringin' me joy
Movin' me on like a river
Rollin' me on
Movin' me on like a river
Rollin' me on

I know now I'm going
There's no time to waste on a sleep
Across a nation of visions of you
Movin' me too, closer to you

Movin' me on like a river
Rollin' me on
I'm closer to you
Movin' me on like a river

Rollin' me on
I'm closer to you
Movin' me on like a river
Rollin' me on
I'm closer to you

Movin' me on like a river
Rollin' me on
Like a river, movin' me on
I'm closer to you
Like a river, movin' me on
I'm closer to you

Like a river, movin' me on
