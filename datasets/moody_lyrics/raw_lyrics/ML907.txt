I cheated on my love
I cheated on my taxes
Burned bridges, ground axes

I stole cars, I stole dope
Left scars, killed hope

What kind of man do you think I am, babe?
One twist and I'd do it all again, babe
What kind of man got these holes in his mind?
Do the same thing over and over again
Expecting something different this time
What kind of man do you think I am?

I'm livin' in your house
I'm holdin' your hand
Sleepin' in your bed
Cookin' in your pan

You see the man who loves you
You see the man you love
But I have hidden claws
Inside these gloves

What kind of man do you think I am?
One twist and I'd do it all again
What kind of man got these holes in his mind?
Do the same thing over and over again
Expecting it'd be different this time
What kind of man do you think I am? Give it

Come clean and stand tall
To thee thine own self be true
But sometimes I don't know
Who's foolin' who

It's not place to question
Not my place to know
Now tell me
What kind of man gonna run this kind of show?

What kind of man do you think I am, babe?
Another thing comin' if you think I can, babe?
Pick you up every chance I get
Well, I've broken your heart for no other reason
Than my mind was already set
Oh, what kind of man?
What kind of man do you think I am?

What? What? What?
What kind of man do you think I am?
Oh, what kind of man?
What kind of man do you think I am?
What kind of man do you think I am?
