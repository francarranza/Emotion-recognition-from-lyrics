I can't stay mad at you.
You can make me cry
You can break my heart
But I'll never say we're through 
And even when I shout 
I can't stay mad at you
I can't stay mad at you

I got mad at you last night
When you were holding
Another girl tight
But when I thought about all your charms 
I bounced right back into your arms...

I think you'll know for sure
I won't be the one to fall in love with someone new
I'll never say goodbye
I can't stay mad at you
