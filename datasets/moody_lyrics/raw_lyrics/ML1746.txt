I'm glad that you accepted
My offer to you when I said
"Excuse Me Miss, what's your name"
That was the spark that lit the flame

You won't be regrettin' it
I promise you'll be satisfied
So relax, cause everything's gonna be all right

Girl, I'm glad that I got you home, tonight
Finally we are alone, tonight
I'm gonna turn down the lights
I'll give you what you like
Girl I'm glad that I got you home
Now that I got you home tonight

First let me take your coat off
And let me show you all around
And if you need somethin'
I think you ought to get it now

'Cause we'll be busy
Doin' whatever's cool
And I don't want interruptions
Between me and you

Girl, I'm glad that I got you home, tonight
Finally we are alone, tonight
I'm gonna turn down the lights
I'll give you what you like
Girl I'm glad that I got you home
Now that I got you home tonight

I can't imagine
Bein' in another place
Except with you
Face to face

I can't imagine
Bein' in another place
Except with you
Face to face

'Cause I've been waitin'
So long for this moment to come
And now you're here
In my arms

Girl, I'm glad that I got you home, tonight
Finally we are alone, tonight
I'm gonna turn down the lights
I'll give you what you like
Girl I'm glad that I got you home
Glad that I got you home tonight

I got you home tonight
I got you home tonight girl
I got you home my baby
I got you home all right
I got you home my girl
I got you home now baby
I got you home tonight girl

Girl, I'm glad that I got you home, tonight
Finally we are alone, tonight
I'm gonna turn down the lights
I'll give you what you like
Girl I'm glad that I got you home
Glad that I got you home tonight
