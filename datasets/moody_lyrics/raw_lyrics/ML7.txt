Seri, Seri, Seri, Serani!
Everywhere I go they find me
Hypocrites and badminds
Every, every, every, every

Everywhere I Go
They fine me
Hypocrites and badminds
Every every every every

Everywhere I Go they find me
Backstabbers and parasites

Some some somebody tell me what
They want from me
Me say ya can't study people
Dem same people a study bare evil
But good ova evil me see say dem feeble
I'm fighting for a cause a mi them can't pause
Yeah me say ya can't study people
Dem same people a study bare evil
But good ova evil me see say dem feeble
I'm fightin for a cause

Because' you know it's everywhere
Evil in the atmosphere things catching
Righteous please beware
We dem watchin
Chit chatting it's clear there's so
Many envious out there
By the power in me
And the help of the father,
Serani never fear another
I'm a live up, never give up, choose the ripper

Somebody tell me what
They want from me
Me say ya can't study people
Dem same people a study bare evil
But good ova evil me see say dem feeble
I'm fighting for a cause a mi them can't pause
Yeah me say ya can't study people
Dem same people a study bare evil
But good ova evil me see say dem feeble

For me, the fassy dem a plan
Dem ago lose the battle
Cause almighty ah me Dan
Me conscience free cah me never do no wrong
A music me make, write and sing song
Remember I said you can see it in their face
We no the genuine ones from the fakes
Judge dem by the way them embrace
Such disgrace...
