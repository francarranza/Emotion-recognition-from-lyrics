You're deaf to it, blind to it 
It's like a thunderclap 
Feel the prickles running 
Up and down your back 
Why so divine, the pain of love 

You have to work at it, stay with it 
Pay for it, bust your ass 
Lie for it, cheat for it 
Forget about your past 
Why so divine, the pain of love 

You dream of it passionate 
You get a rise from it 
Feel the hot cum 
Dripping on your thighs from it 
Why why so divine, the pain of love 

Sometimes you crave for it, cry for it 
Women will die for it 
Looking back, cut the crap 
Was it really worth the rap? 
It's hard to survive the pain of love 

Ooh I need a time out 
Time to make my mind up 
Substitute a line out 
I'll be back next season with a bang 

No release from the jail 
No parole, no bail 
Hard labor, fifty lashes 
Hard labor, money splashes 
It's hard to survive the pain of love 

The old maid is roughing up 
Applying final touches 
Even though she's late for the dance 
I tell you tonight she's really gonna have a ball 
She's gonna really tie me up 
She's gonna really tie me up 
She's gonna really tie me up 
She's gonna really tie me up 
She's gonna really tie me up 

Why so divine the pain of love 

Don't hurt me, don't hurt me 
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me 

Why so divine the pain of love 
That's what they call it: the pain of love 
Tie me up, tie me up, tie me up, tie me up 

Why do divine, the pain of love 

Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt me 
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt me 
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt me...
