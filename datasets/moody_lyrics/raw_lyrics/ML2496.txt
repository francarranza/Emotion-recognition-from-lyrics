I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey hey hey, and I do

Whoa, whoa, I never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

So I should have realised a lot of things before
If this is love you gotta give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more

Whoa, whoa, I never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
You love me too
You love me too
You love me too
