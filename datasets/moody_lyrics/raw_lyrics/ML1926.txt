"Death is just a door," Blake said it first
It's just another room we enter, it's the threshold that hurts
Birth is just a chorus, death is just a verse
In the great song of spring that the mockingbirds sing

We come and we go a-weeping and a-wailing, our heads in the hands of the nurse
Put your head on my shoulder, baby, tell me where it hurts
You say you lost your one and only, could it get any worse?
I say death is just a door, you'll be reunited on the other side

Birth is just a chorus, death is just a verse
In the great song of spring that the mockingbirds sing

We come and we go a-weeping and a-wailing, our heads in the hands of the nurse
Well, put your head on my shoulder, baby, tell me where it hurts
You say you lost your one and only, could it get any worse?
I say death is just a door, you'll be reunited on the other side

Yeah, death is just a door
You'll be reunited on the other side
Yeah, death is just a door
You'll be reunited by and by
