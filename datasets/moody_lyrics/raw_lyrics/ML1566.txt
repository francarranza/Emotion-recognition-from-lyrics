It's very nasty

Eight o'clock on the 405
It feels a little bit different, a little less alive
On the freeway, backed up
Above the viaduct at the window of his Lexus

Big black hole, black, yeah, black, looking back
Hey, today looks and feels distinctly like yesterday
Big bills, big house, big mouth on his big wife
Expels his wife, I had him, what if I had a different life, hey?

Be all you can be
The more that you seize
Will bring you your celebrity

Oh, what a killer life
(It's a killer life)
Oh, what a killer life
Oh, what a killer life
(It's a killer life)
Oh, what a killer life, life

That's how it starts, it all started right there
What do you mean you need a break?
What do you mean the TV needs repair?
"Do I have to do everything?" He asks

He says "I'm sick, yeah I'm sick of this"
So he kills his wife and he kills his kids
That's what he did, hey

Be all you can be
The more that you seize
Will bring you your celebrity

Oh, what a killer life
(It's a killer life)
Oh, what a killer life
Oh, what a killer life
(It's a killer life)
Oh, what a killer life, killer life

Big TV attorneys, big TV covers
They put him on the stand in a Calvin Klein suit
Deals, we're making deals
Turning wheels, trying to get our best foot in the door

Justice, or what it seems
He's too nice to have done it anyway
Life, yeah, that's life
But no more than seven years and eighteen days

He gets caught up in the videos
Magazines and works out and finds the Lord
Loses the Lord and gets a book slash movie deal
For four, yeah, four pa

Then he says hey
Be all you can be
The more that you seize
Will bring you your celebrity

Oh, what a killer life
(It's a killer life)
Oh, what a killer life
Oh, what a killer life
(It's a killer life)
Oh, what a killer life, killer

Oh, what a killer life
(It's a killer life)
Oh, what a killer life
Oh, what a killer life
(It's a killer life)
Oh, what a killer life

Oh, what a killer life
(It's a killer life)
Oh, what a killer life
Oh, what a killer life
(It's a killer life)
Oh, what a killer life

(It's a killer life)
Oh, a killer life
(It's a killer life)
Oh what a, oh what a killer life
