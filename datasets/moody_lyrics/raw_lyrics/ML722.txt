When He rolls up His sleeves
He ain't just puttin' on the Ritz
(our God is an Awesome God)
There is thunder in His footsteps
And lightning in His fists
(our God is an Awesome God)
Well the Lord He wasn't jokin'
When He kicked 'em out of Eden
It wasn't for no reason that He shed His blood
His return is very close and so you better be believin'
That our God is an Awesome God

Our God (our God) is an Awesome God
He Reigns (he reigns) from heaven above
With Wisdom (with wisdom)pow'r and love
Our God is an Awesome God

When the sky was starless in the void of the night
(our god is an awesome god)
He spoke into the darkness and created the light
(our god is an awesome god)
Judgement and wrath He poured out the Sodom
Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross
I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten that
Our God is an Awesome God
