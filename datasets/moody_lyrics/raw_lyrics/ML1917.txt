You're fractured and cold but your heart is unbroken
My favourite foremost coastal Antarctic shelf
Oh Larsen B, oh you can fall on me
Oh Larsen B, desalinate the barren sea

Oh I, I think it's over again
Like sawblades through the air
Your winter overture
Cut through everything, and now we're not so sure
Oh Larsen B, oh won't you fall on me?

You had twelve thousand years
And now it's all over
Five hundred billion tonnes of the purest pack ice and snow
Oh Larsen B, oh won't you fall on me?
Oh Larsen B, desalinate the barren sea

Oh I, think it's the start of the end
Like sawblades through the air
Your winter overture
Cut through everything, and now we're not so sure

Oh Larsen B, Oh fall on me
Oh Larsen B, Oh fall on me
Oh Larsen B, Oh Larsen B
Oh won't you fall on me?
Oh you can fall on me
