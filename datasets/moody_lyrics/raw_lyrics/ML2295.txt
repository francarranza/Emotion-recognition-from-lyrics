Seek out the darkness, welcome wretchedness
Submerged in hatred, blasphemy, and death
Desire the fire, become evil's flame
Allegiance to the unlord, kill and kill again

Within the darkness, all is consumed
Inclined to madness, chaos, and doom
Overflowing evil, bound by wickedness
With unholy eyes of the serpent, void of righteousness

Dead is the world I live in, evil is the air I breath
Where the light has failed, darkness now prevails.
