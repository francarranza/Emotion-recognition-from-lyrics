There' a light
A certain kind of light
It's never shown on me
I want my whole life to be
Lived with you
Lived with you

There's a way
Everybody say
Do each and every little thing
What good does it bring
If I ain't got you If I ain't got you
If I ain't got you If I ain't got you

You don't know
What it's like
Baby you don't know
What it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

In my brain
See your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
And I'm blind so blind

But I'm a woman
Can't you see what I am
I live and breathe for you
What good does it do
If I ain't got you If I ain't got you
If I ain't got you If I ain't got you

Say you don't know
What it's like
Baby you don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

Oh'a, you don't know
What it's like
Baby you don't know
What it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you
