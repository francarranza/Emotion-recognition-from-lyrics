I live out here in the wind and the pouring rain
Somewhere between 14th Avenue and Main
In the summer heat, winter's freezing snow
You see I got nowhere else to go

Got no home sweet home
Into this world, somewhere by the road
And it's a long hard road we walk
On our way to home sweet home

People pass by, they don't see me here
And if they do they wish I would disappear
I guess they know way down deep in their bones
It could be them out there looking for a home

For a home sweet home
Into this world, somewhere by the road
And it's a long hard road we walk
On our way to home sweet home

Ought to have a place to lay my head
A crumb or two for my daily bread
Perhaps someday a kind soul will come upon
Help me find my way back where I belong

Back to a home sweet home
Into this world, somewhere by the road
And it's a long hard road we walk
On our way to home sweet home

Sweet home
Oh that street, I can call it home
And it's a long hard road we walk
All the way to home sweet home
