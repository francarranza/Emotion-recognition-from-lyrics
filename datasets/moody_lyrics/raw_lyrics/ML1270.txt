I've always loved your love
In and out up and down
If your love is a ship
I pull your anchor and I Christen it

I'm in love with love
(I'm in love)
And it broke me in two
(In two)
I'm in love with love
Look out baby, it's gonna break you too

I'd pull your ship across the ocean wide
Hold my breath
And dive dive dive
If they held me at the bottom
Then asked me why
I'd open my mouth and I'd tell 'em why 'cause

I'm in love with love
(I'm in love)
And it broke me in two
(In two)
I'm in love with love
So look out baby, it's gonna break you too

We're huddled up on benches
We're saying our prayers
Two lovers in the mist
With the salt in their hair

I'm in love I'm in love

And it broke me in two
I'm in love I'm in love
It's gonna break you too
Yes it will

The waves are breaking in a foreign tongue
Understand but I'm feeling numb.
If your love was a ship
I'd pull your anchor and hang on to it

I'm in love with love
(I'm in love)
And it broke me in two
(In two)
I'm in love with love
So look out baby
It's gonna break you too

I'm in love with love
(I'm in love)
And it broke me in two
(In two)
I'm in love with love
So look out baby
It's gonna break you too

Oh I'm feelin' love
I'm feeling the love babe
Yeah, I'm feeling love
