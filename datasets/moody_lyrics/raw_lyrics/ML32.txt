Let's don't worry my brother
In this world we are all the same
We must find peace
We must find it together
Is not far away from your heart
You've got the good vibration

Let your heart follow the rhythm
When the voice give you emotion
You have fulfill peace

When the butterfly dances in the sky
When you want to sing what you like
You've got the good sensation
You've got the good sensation
You've got the good vibration

You've got the good vibration

Lets don't worry my brother
In this world we are all the same
We must find peace
We must find it together
Is not far away from your heart
You've got the good vibration
You've got the good vibration
You've got the good vibration
