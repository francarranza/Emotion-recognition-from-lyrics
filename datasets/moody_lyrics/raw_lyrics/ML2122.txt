Brave in the clothes of Georgie's
You take a train to the north
Winding through New York state
In the morning leaves on the floor

Gentle the rain at home
Gentle the rain at home
When we can and will return
When we can and will return

He said I could just take the canoe
Whenever I need
And if I go back over the lake
The clouds may recede

Gentle the rain at home
Gentle the rain at home
When we can and will return
When we can and will return
