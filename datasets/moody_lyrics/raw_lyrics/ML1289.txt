Loose ends, they tangle down
And then take flight
But never tie me down
Never tie me down

Loose ends, they tangle down
And then take flight
But never tie me down
But never tie me down

Off I go
Where I fall is where I land
Off I go
Where I fall is where I land

Loose ends tangle down
And then take flight
But never tie us
They never tie us down

Loose ends tangle down
And then take flight
But never tie us down
But never tie us down

Off I go
Where I fall is where I land
Off I go
Where I fall is where I land

Oh

Off I go
Where I fall is where I land
Off I go
Where I fall is where I land
