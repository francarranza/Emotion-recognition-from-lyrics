Conquistador your stallion stands 
In need of company 
And like some angel's haloed brow 
You reek of purity 
I see your armour-plated breast 
Has long since lost its sheen 
And in your death mask face 
There are no signs which can be seen 

And though I hoped for something to find 
I could see no maze to unwind 

Conquistador a vulture sits 
Upon your silver shield 
And in your rusty scabbard now 
The sand has taken seed 
And though your jewel-encrusted blade 
Has not been plundered still 
The sea has washed across your face 
And taken of its fill 

And though I hoped for something to find 
I could see no maze to unwind 

Conquistador there is no time 
I must pay my respect 
And though I came to jeer at you 
I leave now with regret 
And as the gloom begins to fall 
I see there is no, only all 
And though you came with sword held high 
You did not conquer, only die 

And though I hoped for something to find 
I could see no maze to unwind
