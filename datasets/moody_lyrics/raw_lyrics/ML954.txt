You're lifting me up
Never let me down
And I smile
Whenever you're around

Ooh and I've got a feeling
It'll work out right
Can't stop thinking about you
Every day and night 

Ooh, I got a love 
This love 
Yeah, I got a love 
This love 

Well, I've been in love
And I've lost
I can count the tears
But I can't count the cost

Oh, I've been down
I've been used
Now I know, I know, I know
That I just can't lose

Ooh, I got a love 
This love 
Yeah, I got a love 
This love 

Yeah, I got a love 
This love 
Ooh, I got a love 
This love 

Yeah, I got a love 
This love 
Ooh, I got a love 
This love 

I got a love 
This love's got a hold on me
I got a love 
This love 

Ooh, I got a love 
This love 
I got a love 
This love's got a hold on me
