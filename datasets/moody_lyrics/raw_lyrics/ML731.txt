Spending my day
Thinking 'bout you girl being here with you
Being near with you, can't explain myself
I feel like I do, though it hurt me so
To let you know when I look in your eyes

And if you let me know how you feel
Let me know if this love is really real
But it seems to me
That I'm wrapped up in your love

Don't you know that I'm still in love
Sho' 'nuff in love with you, hey
Heaven knows that I'm still in love
In love with you, hey

Hey, hey, when I look in your eyes
Aw, for all the years I see
Me loving you and you loving me, hey seem to me
That I'm still wrapped up in your love

Don't you know that I'm still in love
Sho' 'nuff in love with you, hey I'm, I'm
To know that I'm still in love
Sho' 'nuff in love with you, hey
Yeah, I try if you want me to, I'm, I'm
