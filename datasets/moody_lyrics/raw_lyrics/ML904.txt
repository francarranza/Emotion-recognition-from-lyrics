We don't care if you only love we
We don't care if you only love we

We love you
We love you
And we hope that you will love we too

We love they
We love they
And we want you to love they too

We don't care if you hound we
And lock the doors around we
We've locked it in our minds
'Cause we love you
We love you

You will never win we
Your uniforms don't fit we
You're dead and then we're in
'Cause we love you

Of course, we do

I love you
I love you
And I hope that you will love me too
We love you
We do
We love you
We do
