I'll never smile again 
Until I smile at you 
I'll never laugh again 
What good would it do 
For tears would fill my eyes 
My heart would realize 
That our romance is through 

I'll never love again 
I'm so in love with you 
I'll never thrill again 
To somebody new 
Within my heart 
I know I would never start 
To smile again 
Until I smile at you 

Within my heart 
I know I would never start 
To smile again 
Until I smile at you 
Until I smile at you
