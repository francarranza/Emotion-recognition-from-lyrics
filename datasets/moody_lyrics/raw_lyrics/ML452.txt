So much trouble in the world now
So much trouble in the world now

Bless my eyes this morning
Jah sun is on the rise once again
The way Earthly things are going
Anything can happen

You see men sailing on their ego trips
Blast off on their space ship
Million miles from reality
No care for you, no care for me

So much trouble in the world now
So much trouble in the world now
All you got to do is give a little
Give a little, give a little
One more time YE-A-H! YE-Ah!

So you think you have found the solution
But it's just another illusion
So before you check out your tide
Don't leave another cornerstone
Standing there behind
We've got to face the day
Ooh-we come what may
We the street people talking
We the people struggling

Now they are sitting on a time bomb
Now I know the time has come
What goes on up is coming on down
Goes around and comes around

So much trouble in the world
So much trouble in the world
So much trouble in the world
There is so much trouble
There is so much trouble
There is so much trouble
There is so much trouble in the world
There is so much trouble in the world
