It was a morning, long before dawn
Without a warning I found he was gone
How could he do it
Why should he do it
He never done it before

Am I blue
Am I blue
Ain't these tears, in these eyes telling you
How can you ask me "am I blue"
Why, wouldn't you be too
If each plan
With your man
Done fell through

There was a time
When I was his only one
But now I'm
The sad and lonely one... lonely

Was I gay
Until today
Now he's gone, and we're through
Am I blue
