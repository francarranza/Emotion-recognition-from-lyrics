I know my eyes already like you
Baby you, I know that love, love is found
Love is found

I cut the radio on, I know there won't be long
I can hear you baby, I can feel your sound
I put thing closer now, now like I feel the sound

I know my eyes already like you
Baby you, I know that love, love is found
Love is found

Oh, my heart go ba-boom-boom-boom, ba-boom-boom-boom
My heart go ba-boom-boom-boom ba-boom-boom-boom

I know my eyes already like you
Baby you, I know that love, love is found
Love is found

Oh, my heart go ba-boom-boom-boom, ba-boom-boom-boom
My heart go ba-boom-boom-boom ba-boom-boom-boom

I know my eyes already like you
Baby you, I know that love, love is found
Love is found
