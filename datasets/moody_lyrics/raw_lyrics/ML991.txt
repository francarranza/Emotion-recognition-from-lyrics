Rollin' with the flow, goin' where the lonely go
Anywhere the lights are low, goin' where the lonely go

Makin' up things to do
Not runnin' in all directions trying to find you
I'm just rollin' with the flow, goin' where the lonely go

And I've got to keep goin', I can't lay down
Sleep won't hardly come where there's loneliness all around
I've got to keep goin', travelin' down this lonesome road
I'll be rollin' with the flow, goin' where the lonely go

I've got to keep goin', I can't lay down
Sleep won't hardly come where there's loneliness all around
I've got to keep goin', travelin' down this lonesome road
I'll be rollin' with the flow, goin' where the lonely go
