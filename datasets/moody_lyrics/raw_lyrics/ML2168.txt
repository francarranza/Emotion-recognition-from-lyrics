Come on
Baby, don't you wanna go?
Come on
Baby, don't you wanna go?
Back to that same old place
Sweet home Chicago

One and one is two
Two and two is four
The way I love you, little girl
You'll never know

Come on
Baby, don't you wanna go?
Back to that same old place
Sweet home Chicago

Four and two is six
Six and two is eight
Look here, baby
Don't you hesitate

Cryin', hey
Baby, don't you wanna go?
Back to the same old place
Sweet home Chicago

Come on
Baby, don't you wanna go?
Come on
Baby, don't you wanna go?
Back to that same old place
Sweet home Chicago
