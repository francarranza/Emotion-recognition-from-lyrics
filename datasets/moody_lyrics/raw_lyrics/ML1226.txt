War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And love means nothing
In some strange quarters
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers
(War)

People fill the world
With narrow confidence
Like a child at birth
A man with no defense
What's mine's my own
I won't give it to you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do

Now we're fighting in our hearts
Fighting in the streets
Won't somebody help me

War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And love means nothing
In some strange quarters
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers
(War)

Man is far behind
In the search for something new
Like a Philistine
We're burning witches too
This world of fate
Must be designed for you
It matters what you say
It matters what you do

Now we're fighting in our hearts
Fighting in the streets
Won't somebody help me

War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And love means nothing
In some strange quarters
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers
(War)

(War war war war war
War war war war war
War war war war war
War war war war war
War war war war war)

After the bird has flown
He walked ten thousand miles back home
You can't do that to me, no
You can't do that to me
You can't do that to me, no
You can't do that to me

(War
War)

In this heart of mine
I'll find a place for you
For black or white
For all the children, too

Now we're fighting in our hearts
Fighting in the streets
Won't somebody help me

War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And love means nothing
In some strange quarters
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers

No more war
(War, war is stupid)
Said no more war
(And people are stupid)
Said war
(And love means nothing
In some strange quarters)
I said war
No more war
(War, war is stupid)
Said no more war
(And people are stupid)
Said war
(And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers)

Said no more war
(War, war is stupid
And people are stupid)
I said no more war
(And love means nothing
In some strange quarters)
Senso hant-ai
(War, war is stupid
And people are stupid)
Senso hant-ai
Say no more war
(And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers)
Say no more

No more war
(War, war is stupid)
Say no more war
(And people are stupid
And love means nothing)
Say no more war
(In some strange quarters
War, war is stupid)
And no more war
(And people are stupid)
Oh, war
(And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers)
I said no more war

(War, war is stupid)
And no more war
(And people are stupid)
Oh, war
(And love means nothing
In some strange quarters).
