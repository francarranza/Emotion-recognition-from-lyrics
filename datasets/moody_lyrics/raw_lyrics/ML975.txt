I curse to hell the magistrate who granted this unholy fate
But I know, I know I asked for this myself I'm bound by law to hell
And it's Sick! Sick! Sick!
Humans have their needs, living in a fairy tale that's tearing at the seem
A dank reject, a devil in a dress, exactly what you see

Sick! Sick! Sick!
It's Sick! Sick! Sick!

You made a mess of things
My what a mess you've made
I hate the way you make me feel
I hate the way you make me
And your world its cold outside
So button up and open wide
I hate the way you make me feel
Sick! Sick! Sick!

If memory serves me correct I gave you all, you gave me less
You're sex capades deliver checks, but can't afford you self respect
And it's Sick! Sick! Sick!
Humans on their knees, living in a fairy tale that's tearing at the seems
A dank reject, a devil in a dress, exactly what you see
Sick! Sick! Sick!

You made a mess of things
My what a mess you've made
I hate the way you me feel

I hate the way you make me
Your world is cold outside
So button up and open wide
I hate the way you make me feel
Sick! Sick! Sick!

Maybe love is looking for someone to fill the holes
We grow up building lives with holes in all our walls
The walls could fall but here you were with spare bricks to save the day
And we pray it's not too late spare bricks could be dead weight

Sick! Sick! Sick!
It's Sick! Sick! Sick!
Sick! Sick! Sick!
You're Sick! Sick! Sick!

You made a mess of things
My what a mess you've made
I hate the way you make me feel
I hate the way you make me
And you're world is cold outside
So button up and open wide
I hate the way you make me feel
Sick! Sick! Sick
