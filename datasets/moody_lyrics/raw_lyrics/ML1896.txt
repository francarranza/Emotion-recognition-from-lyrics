Feel the danger, see the glory
Hear the thunder of a heavy metal
It will take you, hypnotise you
Raise your fist with a rebel yell

I am metal and I'll never die
We are metal and we'll never die

I will crank you up
You can't bring me down
I will make you high
Metal will never die

Nothing evil, nothing sacred
Just the power that's been created
Let it take you and possess you
Shout it out with a voice from hell

I am metal and I'll never die
We are metal and we'll never die

I will crank you up
You can't bring me down
I will make you high
Metal will never die

I will crank you up
You can't bring me down
I will make you high
Metal will never die

I will crank you up
You can't bring me down
I will make you high
Metal will never die

Metal will never die
