Well she's on the dance floor at your local jook
Trying to sweat a bunch of fools she done already took
But when that gal gets down you can't help but stare
Cause that frames lit and smoking like a signal flare

She's on fire
She's on fire
She's on fire
She's on fire

We tried to look away we all tried to be cool
But she had an ass as thick as an army mule's
She asked out for a drink just a batting those eyes
We all was reaching for our wallets man she's a light

She's on fire
She's on fire
She's on fire
She's on fire

With a smooth proposition she's got you in hand
I hear you say you don't care boy are you a man

She's on fire
She's on fire
She's on fire
She's on fire
