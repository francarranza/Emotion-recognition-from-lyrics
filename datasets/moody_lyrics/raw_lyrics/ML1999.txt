Happy holiday, happy holiday
While the merry bells keep ringing
May your every wish come true

Happy holiday, happy holiday
May the calendar keep bringing
Happy holidays to you

Seeing old friends, oh, the fun of it all
At holiday time, holiday time
Presents and goodies and everything fine
At holiday time, holiday time

Happy holiday, oh, happy holiday
While the merry bells keep ringing
May your every wish come true

Happy holiday, happy holiday
May the calendar keep bringing
Happy holidays to you

Merry Christmas
Happy holiday, happy holiday
