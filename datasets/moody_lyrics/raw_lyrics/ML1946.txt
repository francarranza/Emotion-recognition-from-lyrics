Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

I can see it in his eyes (Oh I), and he's been avoiding me all day
It seems as though he wants to cry, (Oh, I) and he's been acting really strange
He starts talkin' and I tuned him out
It doesn't matter anyway
Because I knew as soon as I saw clouds, yeah
I knew what he was gonna say

'Cause when the tears start flowin' and the wind starts blowin'
That's how you know it's comin' for you
When the rain start fallin' and you feel the pain comin'
That's how you know it's comin' for you

Just like a hurricane, just like a hurricane, the way you break everything that comes in your way
Just like a hurricane, Just like a hurricane, the way you broke my heart and now I'm left with the pain
After the hurricane

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Baby I'm not surprised, Oh I
You said just what I thought you would
And it hurts I ain't gon' lie oh I
But it doesn't hurt as bad as it could

'Cause when the tears start flowin' and the wind starts blowin'
That's how you know it's comin' for you
When the rain start fallin' and you feel the pain comin'
That's how you know it's comin' for you (hey baby)

Just like a hurricane, just like a hurricane, the way you break everything that comes in your way
Just like a hurricane, Just like a hurricane, the way you broke my heart and now I'm left with the pain
After the hurricane

Now my life is shattered, and I'm left to pick up the pieces
And find a new beginning and put it back together again
After the hurricane, the hurricane

Just like a hurricane, just like a hurricane, the way you break everything that comes in your way
Just like a hurricane, Just like a hurricane, the way you broke my heart and now I'm left with the pain
After the hurricane
