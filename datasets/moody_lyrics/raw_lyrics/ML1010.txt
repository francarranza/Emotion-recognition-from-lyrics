Fire on the bayou
Fire on the bayou
Fire on the bayou
Fire on the bayou

Down in New Orleans, in Lucky's din
He wouldn't deal y'all for a 5th of gin
One dude wanted a bottle of wine
Hit that dude yes he did up for a dollar and a dime

Fire on the bayou
Fire on the bayou

Take a little toke on your smoke
Buy yourself a bottle of wine
Cool, cool wine going down your throat
Don't try and tell me don't make you feel fine

Fire on the bayou
Fire on the bayou

I got a nickel now, you got a dime
Let's get together and have a good time
Goin' to buy a fifth, going to buy a joint
When you gettin' down now, you doin' things right"

"I got swamp water runnin' through my veins
The Mississippi River can't be tamed
I pole my pirogue in the middle of the night
I'm an uptown ruler, I can do it right"
