Are you ready to take a chance and risk it all?
It's do or die, fight or flight.
Do you want to feel alive?

So would you play a game of Russian roulette to save your life?
Are you in?
Are you in?
Or will you flee to safety and wonder what could've been?
Don't be afraid, don't ever be afraid.

Oh, you've been hiding. you've been hiding.
You've been hiding in the shadows.

When you're afraid, when you're afraid.
Take a chance, don't let it weigh you down.
You gotta get out of there.
When you're afraid, when you're afraid
Take a chance, don't let it weigh you down.
You gotta get out.

You're trapped in a cave, confined.
Falling back to the comfort of your world.

The last time you walked away from this,
You were looking back to see what you missed.

When you're afraid, when you're afraid,
Take a chance, don't let it weigh you down.
You gotta get out of there.
When you're afraid, when you're afraid,
Take a chance, don't let it weigh you down.
You gotta get out.

Take a chance, take a breath,
Take a shot with a gun to your head.
Take a chance, take a breath,
Take a shot like the gun is to your head.
Like the gun is to your head.

When you're afraid, when you're afraid,
Take a chance, don't let it weigh you down.
You gotta get out of there.
When you're afraid, when you're afraid,
Take a chance, don't let it weigh you down.
You gotta get out.
Stop hiding in the shadows.
