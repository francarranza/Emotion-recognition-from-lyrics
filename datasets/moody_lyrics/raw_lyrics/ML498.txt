I can recall a certain magic in your eyes
I'm under your spell each time that your appear
A kiss so passionate that has me mesmerized
I fall more in love each time that you are near

Star light, star bright
Your love shines near or far just like
The brightest star
Sweet things you do
It sets my heart aglow
And I want you to know

They remind me
I'm lucky I'm falling
In love with you darling
Remind me
I'm lucky I'm falling
In love with you darling

You hold me close and whisper soft and low
Those three little words that mean so much to me
You know how to make my feelings show
We're just like a song in perfect harmony

You remind me
I'm lucky I'm falling
In love with you darling
Remind me
I'm lucky I'm falling
In love with you darling
Remind me,
I'm lucky I'm falling
In love with you darling
Remind me
I'm lucky I'm falling
In love with you darling

You whisper soft and low
Touch me hold me,
Don't let me go
I love you so
That magic in your eyes
Looked right through me
I'm hypnotized, mesmerized
You whisper soft and low
Touch me hold me,
Don't let me go
I love you so
