Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me
Will you take the pain I will give to you
Again and again, and will you return it

There'll be times when my crimes
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life livable

But when you think I've had enough from your sea of love
I'll take more than another riverful
Yes, and I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me
Will you take the pain I will give to you
Again and again, and will you return it

There'll be days when I'll stray
I may appear to be constantly out of reach
I give in to sin
Because I like to practice what I preach

I'm not trying to say I'll have it all my way
I'm always willing to learn when you've got something to teach
Oh, and I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Pain, will you return it
I'll say it again, pain
Pain, will you return it
I'll say it again, pain

Pain, will you return it
I'll say it again, pain
Pain, will you return it
I won't say it again

Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me

Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me

Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me

Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me
