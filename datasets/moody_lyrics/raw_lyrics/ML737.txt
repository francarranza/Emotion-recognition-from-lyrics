You can't kill the metal
The metal will live on
Punk rock tried to kill the metal
But they failed as they were smacked to the ground

New Wave tried to kill the metal
But they failed as they were stricken down to the ground
Grunge tried to kill the metal
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
They failed, as they were thrown to the ground

Ah, yeah
Ah, yeah

No one can destroy the metal
The metal will strike you down with a vicious blow
We are the vanquished foes of the metal
We tried to win for why we do not know

New Wave tried to destroy the metal
But the metal had its way
Grunge then tried to de-throne the metal
But metal was in the way

Punk rock tried to destroy the metal
But metal was much too strong
Techno tried to defile the metal
But techno was proven wrong, yeah

Metal
It's come from hell
