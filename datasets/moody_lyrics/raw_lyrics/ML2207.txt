You made a man out of me
But you're not satisfied
You don't believe what you see
You don't believe when I
Got a million things on my mind cause of you
I don't know what I'm gonna do

I only wanted to love you
You only wanted a taste
My ambition to woo you
Was all the time that we waste
Time that we wasted

Why don't you set me free? yeah
Why don't you set me free?
Why don't you set me free? yeah
Why don't you set me free?

And every time that I think about the better days
Remember how we woud kiss
When we were high on haze?
We never knew about the way things work
I still need to forget

'Cause when you wanted protection
You used to call out my name, yes you did
And all this changing direction
Ain't making me feel the same about you

Why don't you set me free? yeah
Why don't you set me free?
Why don't you set me free? yeah
Why don't you set me free?

All you got to do is just set me free
So easy
