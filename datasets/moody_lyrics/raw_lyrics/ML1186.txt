Meaningless
It's meaningless
It's meaningless
It's meaningless
I take the hold
I take the hold
I take the hold
I take the hold

Mindlessness
It's mindlessness
It's mindlessness
It's mindlessness
I bled for days
I bled for days
I bled for days
I bled for days

Get to the rage
Hate
The healing of it with it
Conceal the scabs
Hate
You don't want to show
Into the hate
No
I channel all the negative

Get to the rage
Hate
The healing of it with it
Conceal the scabs
Hate
You don't want to show
Into the hate
No
I channel all the negative
And I bled for days now I take the hold

I don't believe it
Fuck me, read me, get me
(Bled for days)
Smile on my rage, I'm scarred by age
I bled for days

Uselessness
It's uselessness
It's uselessness
It's uselessness

I make my weapons
Make my weapons
Make my weapons
Take the hold

I don't believe it
Fuck me, read me, get me
(Bled for days)
Smile on my rage, I'm scarred by age
I bled for days

I don't believe it
Fuck me, read me, get me
(Bled for days)
Smile on my rage, I'm scarred by age
I bled for days

Bled for days
Bled for days
Get to the rage
Hate
The healing of it with it
Conceal the scabs
Hate
You don't want to show
Into the hate
No
I channel all the negative
And I bled for days now I take the hold

Bled for days
