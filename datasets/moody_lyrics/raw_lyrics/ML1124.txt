Now, this could only happen to a guy like me
And only happen in a town like this
So may I say to each of you, most gratefully
As I throw each one of you a kiss

This is my kind of town
Chicago is my kind of town
Chicago is my kind of people too
People who smile at you and

Each time I roam
Chicago is calling me home
Chicago is why I just grin like a clown
It's my kind of town

My kind of town
Chicago is my kind of town
Chicago is my kind of raz-ma-taz
And it has all that jazz and

Each time I leave
Chicago is tuggin' my sleeve
Chicago is a Wrigley Building
Chicago is the Union Stockyard
Chicago is one town that won't let you down
It's my kind of town
