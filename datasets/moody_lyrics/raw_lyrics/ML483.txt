The shackles are undone
The bullet's quit the gun
The heat that's in the sun
Will keep us when there's none

The rule has been disproved
The stone it has been moved
The grave is now a groove
All debts are removed, ooh

Oh can't you see what our love has done
Oh can't you see what our love has done
Oh can't you see what our love has done
What it's doing to me

Love makes strange enemies
Makes love where love may please
Soul and its striptease
Hate brought to its knees

The sky over our head
You can reach it from our bed
If you let me in your heart
And out of my head

Oh can't you see what our love has done
Oh can't you see what our love has done
Oh can't you see what our love has done
What it's doing to me

Ah ah ah ah, oh
Ah ah ah ah, oh
Please don't ever let me out of you

I've got no shame
Oh no, oh no

Oh can't you see what our love has done
Oh can't you see what our love has done
Oh can't you see what our love has done
What it's doing to me

Oh can't you see what our love has done / I know I hurt you and I made you cry
Oh can't you see what our love has done / Did everything but murder you and I
Oh can't you see what our love has done / But love left a window in the skies
What it's doing to me / And to love I rhapsodize

Oh can't you see what our love has done / To every broken heart
Oh can't you see what our love has done / For every heart it cries
Oh can't you see what our love has done / Love left a window in the skies
What it's doing to me / And to love I rhapsodize

Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh / Oh can't you see
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
