Alright let's go
There's gonna be one less lonely
One less lonely girl
One less lonely
One less lonely
There's gonna be one less lonely
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl

How many "I told you's" and "start over's" and shoulders have you cried on before?
How many promises? Be honest, girl
How many tears you let hit the floor?
How many bags you packed
Just to take them back?
Tell me that how many "either or's"?
But no more if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

(Oh oh, oh) Saw so many pretty faces before I saw you (you)
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)

(No no) Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when you're mine, in the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first
(I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth
That's what I'm gonna do
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Christmas wasn't merry, 14th of February not one of them spent with you
How many dinner dates, set dinner plates
And he didn't even touch his food
How many torn photographs are you taping back?
Tell me that you couldn't see an open door
But no more, if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

(Oh oh, oh) Saw so many pretty faces before I saw you (you)
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)

(No no) Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when you're mine, in this world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first
(I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth
That's what I'm gonna do
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I can give you a brand new start

I just wanna set one girl free to fall (free to fall)
She's free to fall (fall in love)

I'll take her and leave the world with one less lonely

One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
