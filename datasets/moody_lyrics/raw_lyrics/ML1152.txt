Afterwhile, this too shall pass, afterwhile 
Scars will heal, you'll love again 
It won't hurt you, afterwhile 
Stuck between if and when 
You prayed, you tried, but still no end 

God's purpose soon you'll understand 
It won't hurt you, afterwhile
It won't hurt you, afterwhile

Afterwhile, this too shall pass, afterwhile 
Scars will heal, you'll love again 
It won't hurt you, afterwhile 
Stuck between if and when 
You prayed, you tried, but still no end 

So when the pain has come to end 
And now your heart is whole again 
Help someone who needs to know 
That it won't hurt, afterwhile
