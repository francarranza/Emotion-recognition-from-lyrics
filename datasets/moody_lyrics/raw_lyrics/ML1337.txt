Train's speeding over the tracks
I can't see through the fog
I can't see where you're at

Take every sin from your heart
And put it to good use
Let it out from the start

Oh I got you
Oh I need you
It's easy to believe what you do

Oh I got you
Oh I need you
It's easy to believe in the truth

We'll tear the air from your lungs
The picture isn't clear
Doesn't show anyone

Black turns to gray in the sun
It always fades away
The colors bleed and they run

Oh I got you
Oh I need you
It's easy to believe what you do

Oh I got you
Oh I need you
It's easy to believe in the truth
