Well, I think it's time to get ready
To realize just what I have found
I have lived only half of what I am
It's all clear to me now

My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah, girl, yeah

There's something inside that's making me crazy
I'll try to keep it together
'Cause what I say may not happen the same way
Now could be forever

My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah, girl, yeah

My love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive

There's a mirror moving inside my mind
Reflecting the love that you shine on me
Hold on now to that feeling
Let it flow, let it grow, yeah, yeah

My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah, girl, yeah

My love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
My love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
Woo hoo
