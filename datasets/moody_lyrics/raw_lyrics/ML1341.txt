Your hand on his arm, haystack charm around your neck
Strung out and thin, callin' some friend, tryin'a cash some check
He's acting dumb, that's what you've come to expect

Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay

He's wearing your clothes, head down to toes a reaction to you
You say you know what he did, but you idiot kid, you don't have a clue
Sometimes they just get caught in the eye you're pulling him through

Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay

Now on the bus, nearly touching this dirty retreat
Fallin' out, 6th and Powell, a dead sweat in my teeth
Gonna walk, walk, walk four more blocks plus the one in my brain
Down, downstairs to the man, he's gonna make it all okay
I can't beat myself, I can't beat myself and I don't want to talk
I'm taking the cure so I can be quiet wherever I want
So leave me alone, you ought to be proud that I'm getting good marks

Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
