Do me wrong, do me right
Tell me lies but hold me tight
Save your goodbyes for the morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight

Say goodbye and say hello
Sure enough good to see you, but it's time to go
Don't say yes, but please don't say no
I don't want to be lonely tonight

Go away then damn you
Go on and do as you please, yeah
You ain't gonna see me getting down on my knees
Undecided and your heart's been divided
You've been turning my world upside down

Do me wrong, do me right right now baby
Go on and tell me lies but hold me tight
Save your goodbyes for the morning light, morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight

I don't want to, I don't need to
I can't stand it, I don't have to
I don't want to be lonely tonight

I don't want to be lonely tonight

No...
