You and I, we fly
You and I, we're part of a fallen ember
And I should say goodbye
But I know it's always now or never

So step easy in the sun

It's simple just to try
You and I, we know not what we're made of
Like a callin' in the night
It's goin' on and on and till forever

So step easy in the sun
The pitfalls here are gone
And there are others that'll bring you along
So step easy in the sun

Simple just to try
You and I, we know not what we're made of
Like a callin' in the night
It's goin' on and on and till forever

So step easy in the sun
The pitfalls here are gone
And there are others that'll bring you along
So step easy in the sun

Step easy in the sun
Step easy in the sun
