Sweet Mary sent a letter to me
She say to "Hurry home
I need you right away.
I've got a stomach full of love
And I'm all alone
All of the day"

Sweet Mary I'm coming home
Coming home to you, hey-ey!
Sweet Mary I'm coming home
That's the least I can do.

Sweet Mary in that letter to me
She said "It's up to you
I need you right away"
And now I got to hop a freight
Back to the farm and all
I've got to be

Sweet Mary I'm coming home
Coming home to you, yeah-hey.

Sweet Mary has a smile on her face
You know she's happy to see me wrap her in an embrace
I only hope that the passing of time
She'll always feel that way
And I won't pack up my things
