I don't love you anymore

I don't love you anymore like the way I did before
And since you've found someone new I think it's best
I don't try and walk the floor I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less
I don't love you anymore for I've got no more love to give
You drained my heart of all its love with every sweet caress
I keep saying o'er and o'er I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less
I held you close to me one time I kissed your lips and called you mine
But another came and thrilled you more I guess
I cried as you walked out the door I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less
I don't love you anymore...
Trouble is I don't love you any less
