No use ignoring me, I represent the darkest thing you feel. 
No use avoiding me, I'm woven in the fabric of your being. 
Don't back away from me, I feed on apprehension and fear. 
Don't back away from me, don't blind yourself to what you really should be seeing. 

A part of you that will consume if given the chance to, 
A part of you that will abuse whenever allowed to. 
A part of you that will consume if given the chance to, 
A part of you that wants to see you loose it all. 

C'mon, see what you get. 
C'mon, when will you 
Come to terms with what's inside,
Come to terms with what you try to hide.

Emotion overload, might really mean the end of the road. 
Emotion overload, might mean the end of everything you know.
Emotional check, just might reveal emotional wreck. 
Emotional check, just might reveal your weakness 'cause you've finished.
