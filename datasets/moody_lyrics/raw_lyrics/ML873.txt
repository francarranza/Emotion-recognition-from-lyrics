Ooh, you're giving me the fever tonight
I don't wanna give in, I'd be playing with fire
You forget, I've seen you work before
Take 'em straight to the top, leave 'em crying for more
I've seen you burn 'em before

Fire and ice 
You come on like a flame, then you turn a cold shoulder
Fire and ice 
I wanna give you my love, but you'll just take a little piece of my heart
You'll just tear it apart

Moving in for the kill tonight
You got every advantage when they put out the lights
It's not so pretty when it fades away
'Cause it's just an illusion in this passion play
I've seen you burn 'em before

Fire and ice 
You come on like a flame, then you turn a cold shoulder
Fire and ice 
I wanna give you my love, but you'll just take a little piece of my heart

So you think you got it all figured out
You're an expert in the field, without a doubt
But I know your methods inside and out
And I won't be taken in by fire and ice

Fire and ice 
You come on like a flame, then you turn a cold shoulder
Fire and ice 
I wanna give you my love, but you'll just take a little piece of my heart

You come on like a flame, then you turn a cold shoulder
Fire and ice
I wanna give you my love, but you'll just take a little piece of my heart

You come on like a flame, then you turn a cold shoulder
Fire and ice 
You come on like a flame, then you turn a cold shoulder
Fire and ice
