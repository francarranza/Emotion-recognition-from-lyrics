I found the love I've been looking for
It's a real love, it's a real love
Standing up behind an electric guitar
It's a real love, it's a real love
And all the time I was thinking no way
And all the time I never thought I'd say
I found the love I've been looking for
It's a real love, it's a real love
It's a real love, it's a real love

Said come on baby we really got something
It's a soul connection, you're changin' my world
Give me your affection, be my girl
It's a real love, it's a real love
It's a real love, it's a real love

The thing about you so far, you squeeze my peaches
Then you send me postcards of girls on beaches
You're drinking in a bar in Amsterdam
I'm thinking baby far out, be my man
It's a real love, it's a real love
It's a real love, it's a real love

I found the love I've been looking for
It's a real love, it's a real love
Standing up behind an electric guitar
It's a real love, it's a real love
And all the time I was thinking no way
And all the time I never thought I'd say
I found the love I've been looking for
It's a real love, it's a real love
