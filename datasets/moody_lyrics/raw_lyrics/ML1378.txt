Should've been different, but it wasn't different, was it?
Same old story and Dear John and so long
It should've fit like a glove, it should've fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring, a token of a true love
Should've all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't

There's your trouble, there's your trouble
Keep seeing double with the wrong one
And you can see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

So now you're thinking 'bout all you're missing
How deep your sinkin' 'round and 'round and draggin' down
Why don't you cash in your chips? Why don't you call it a loss?
Not such a big loss, chalk it up for better luck
Could have been true love, but it wasn't
It should all add up, but it doesn't

There's your trouble, there's your trouble
Keep seeing double with the wrong one
And you can see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

Should have all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't

There's your trouble, there's your trouble
Keep seeing double with the wrong one
And you can see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There is your trouble
