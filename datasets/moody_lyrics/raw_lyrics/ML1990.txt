It's a beautiful world we live in
A sweet romantic place
Beautiful people everywhere
The way they show they care
Makes me want to say

It's a beautiful world
It's a beautiful world
It's a beautiful world
For you
For you
For you

It's a wonderful time to be here
It's nice to be alive
Wonderful people everywhere
The way they comb their hair
Makes me want to say

It's a wonderful place
It's a wonderful place
It's a wonderful place
For you
For you
For you

Hey
Tell me what I see

Boy and girl with the new clothes on
You can shake it to me all night long, hey, hey

It's a beautiful world we live in
A sweet romantic place
Beautiful people everywhere
The way they show they care
Makes me want to say

It's a beautiful world
It's a beautiful world
It's a beautiful world
For you
For you
For you

It's not for me
(It's a beautiful world) For you
(It's a beautiful world) For you
(It's a beautiful world) For you
(It's a beautiful world) Not me

(It's a beautiful world)
(It's a beautiful world)
(It's a beautiful world)
