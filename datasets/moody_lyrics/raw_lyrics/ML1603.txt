We have love
We have love
We have love
We have love

We have love, give it up, give it up
There is nothing else to be proud of

We have lost nothing
Keep that thought firm in your mind
When you look but you don't find what you can offer
We have lost nothing
I keep that thought firm in my mind
When I look but I don't find what I can offer
I don't always know what it is you mean to show
But I keep it close to mine and we discover

We have love, give it up, give it up
There is nothing else to be proud of
We have love, give it up, give it up
There is nothing else to be proud of

We have love
We have love
We have love
We have love

I thought my heart was damaged
I thought my heart was strong
A thought is nothing damaged
A thought is nothing wrong

I see it in my care for you
I see it in my care for you

We have love - I see it in my care for you - give it up, give it up
There is nothing else to be proud of - I see it in my care for you
We have love - I see it in my care for you - give it up, give it up
There is nothing else to be proud of - I see it in my care for you
