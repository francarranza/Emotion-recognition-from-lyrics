If I gave you my love,
I tell you what I'd do
I'd expect a whole lotta love outta you

You gotta be good to me

There's a whole lotta things you and I
Could do

What about the way you love me
And the way you squeeze me

And you get right down it
And the love is getting you through it

Simply beautiful
