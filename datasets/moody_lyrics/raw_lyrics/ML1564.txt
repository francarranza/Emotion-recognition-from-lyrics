Corrina, Corrina
Gal, where you been so long?
Corrina, Corrina
Gal, where you been so long?

I been worryin' about you, baby
Baby, please come home

I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that sings
I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that sings

But I ain't a-got Corrina
Life don't mean a thing

Corrina, Corrina
Gal, you're on my mind
Corrina, Corrina
Gal, you're all on my mind

I was sittin' down thinkin' of you
I just can't keep from crying
