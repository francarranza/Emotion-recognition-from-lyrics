I can't understand a word your sayin'
We've got a bad connection on our minds
Communication's one thing we never seem to find
Oh Lord, I'm sorry but there's trouble on the line.

All I get is static when we're talkin'
You say my line is out of order all the time
We have nothin' left in common
Your thoughts are not like mine.
Oh Lord, I'm sorry but there's trouble on the line.

There's trouble on the line
From your heart to mine
Oh lord, I'm sorry
But we're not gettin' through.

The storm keeps gettin' worse
Lord, we might as well quit tryin'
Oh Lord, I'm sorry but there's trouble on the line
Oh Lord, I'm sorry but there's trouble on the line.

The storm keeps gettin' worse
Lord, we might as well quit tryin'
Oh Lord, I'm sorry but there's trouble on the line
Oh Lord, I'm sorry but there's trouble on the line...
