Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
And I think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories
Time after
Sometimes you picture me
And I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, and I can't hear
What you've said
Then you say go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look, you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after

My picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows you're wondering
If I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost you can look, you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after time
Mmm...
