I want to be pretty
Tomorrow, I'll know I'm just dirt

We are the nobodies
Wanna be somebodies
When we're dead they'll know just who we are
We are the nobodies
Wanna be somebodies
When we're dead, they'll know just who we are

Yesterday, I was dirty
Wanted to be pretty
I know, now, that I'm forever dirt

When we're dead, they'll know just who we are

Wanna be somebodies
When we're dead, they'll know just who we are

We fed machines and then we prayed
Puked up and down in morbid faith
You should have seen the ratings that day
