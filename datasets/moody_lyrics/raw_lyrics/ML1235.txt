Sit on your fire escape
Sitting on your fire escape
Sitting on your fire escape
We're plotting our escape
Wet streets of the city below
Wet streets of the city you know
Sitting on your fire escape
Getting ready to make a leap
Sit on your fire escape
Sitting on your fire escape
Have a smoke on the fire escape
Counting birds on the fire escape
Looking down at the city streets
So wet, such a beat
Sitting on your fire escape
Getting ready to make a leap
Are you ready, I'm ready, let's go
Are you ready, I'm ready, let's go
