Un deux trois!
(Turn it up a little bit more)
Bang bang bang!

Feathers, I'm plucking feathers
One by one by one
No more skylarking
Around my head
Your information
But there's no hiding behind
Moulting feathers

On the plane, on my brain
'Bout to do the show
40k contract?
Take it out the door
Dice symbolise my life
Roll 'em on the floor
From your grubby hands
As you ham and grandstand
You live a shitty life
We live the bon bon vie
You hide it in the book
While we watch the TV
Think you got us fooled?
Who? Never again
First time, shame on me
Second time, your time will end

No way
Bang your dead
Paint your silhouette
Je te plumerai la tete
Je te plumerai la tete

Bang your dead
Alouette
Paint your silhouette
Je te plumerai la tete
Je te plumerai la tete

No way
The clock is ticking forward
No way
It's just a cruel cruel world

Cruel world is fitting
They got us all hidden
With late night decisions
And lab rat incisions
When faced with decisions
To fight or fricasse
And you clearly decided
On how to handle me
Difficile, imbecile
Is it fake? Is it real?
Are we dying on our feet?
Are we trying in our sleep?
There's a rumour going round
'Bout the suits running town
If you look into the sky
Dead birds fly high

Numbers, you fly by numbers
You're logging hours
And don't see the big picture
Over your shoulder
You'll get no last words
Because it's too late
You've clipped your own wings,
Your own wings

No way
Bang your dead
Paint your silhouette
Je te plumerai la tete
Je te plumerai la tete

Bang your dead
Alouette
Paint your silhouette
Je te plumerai la tete
Je te plumerai la tete

We're never gonna believe in
The stories that you're weaving
We're never gonna believe in
The stories that you're weaving
We're never gonna believe in
The stories that you're weaving
We believing in the proof
We believing in the truth
We believing in each other not you

Stories (you with the tall tales)
How many stories (so many tall tales)
We climb the structure
(We scale the ladder)
You build it higher (You make us madder)
We take our aim
(So now we're bearing arms)
You perch above your nest
(Gotcha in your charms)
The stories in your head
(Crazy bald-headed)
That's what got you dead

No way
The clock is ticking forward
(As the time just ticks away)
No way
It's just a cruel cruel world
(Cruel cruel world)

No way
Bang your dead
Paint your silhouette
Je te plumerai la tete
Je te plumerai la tete

Bang your dead
Alouette
Paint your silhouette
Je te plumerai la tete
Je te plumerai la tete

Un deux trois
No one ever does it like that anymore
Bang bang bang
When feathers fly, you can deny everything
Alouette

Un deux trois
Bang bang
No one ever does it like that anymore
Bang bang bang
Alouette
When feathers fly, you can deny everything
