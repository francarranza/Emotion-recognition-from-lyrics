There'll never be a spring so perfect again
We'll never see a yellow so rich
The grass will never be quite as green
And there will never be a kiss like your kiss

There will never be a summer so complete
We'll never see a palette like this
The berries will never taste as sweet
There will never be a kiss like your kiss

There will never be an autumn so vivid and warm
So rare, so gold and so crisp
We'll never see it colored in aubergine
There will never be a kiss like your kiss

There'll never be a winter quite so true
When the sky is painted with gifts
And there'll never be a moon so full and blue
There will never be a kiss like your kiss
There will never be a kiss like your kiss
