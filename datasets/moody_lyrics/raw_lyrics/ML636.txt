This is my appeal
To all your leaders out there, to stop the war
'Cause there's no justifiable reason
It's about time that you realize that your not fulfilling your true purpose

This one's for the leaders, who are fighting war
All over the world
This one's for the leaders, who are fighting war
All over the world

Think about the yutes, who are dyng out, (dying out)
Crying out (crying out) for love
Victims of the system, we divide and grow
To break us down, and tear us apart
What is the future of the human race
How will the children grow to take our place
Where is the love that we should all embrace
I do believe it's here, for you and me

This one's for the leaders, who are fighting war
All over the world
This one's for the leaders, who are fighting war
All over the world

This one is for, the leaders who are fighting war
All over the wooorld
Imagine all the money, that you spend on arms
Guns and bombs, to destroy
While people are left hungry, to die from wants
And those who do survive are unemployed
What is the future of the human race
How will the children grow to take our place
Where is the love that we should all embrace
I do believe, it here for you and me

This one's for the leaders, who are fighting war
All over the world
This one's for the leaders, who are fighting war
All over the world

This one
This one (for the children)
This one
This one
This one for the
This one for the
This one for the leaders
This one, this one is for the leaders
