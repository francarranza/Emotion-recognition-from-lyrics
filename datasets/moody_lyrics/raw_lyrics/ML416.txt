Well I don't give a damn that your car's on fire
It ain't none of my concern
I don't really care if you think I'm a lier
I know it's just because your getting burned
That ain't none of my concern
'Cause I'm watchin' your mustang burn

And I know what your thinkin' man your heart is sinking
Your cars going up in flames
And it's driving you crazy just thinking hey maybe
That someone like me is to blame
But that ain't none of my concern
'Cause I'm watchin your mustang burn
No it ain't none of my concern
'Cause I'm watchin your mustang burn

Well she was a vision perfect dimensions
Of what you thought true love would be
And she looked so good
You were under her hood
While your girlfriend was smiling at me
What'd you expect me to do?
I ain't got no ties to you
And it ain't none of my concern
'Cause I'm watchin your mustang burn
I said it ain't none of my concern
Because I'm watchin your mustang burn
