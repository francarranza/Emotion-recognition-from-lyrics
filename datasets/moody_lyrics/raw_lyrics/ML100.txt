Well I take whatever I want
And baby, I want you
You give me something I need
Now tell me I got something for you
Come on, come on, come on and do it
Come on, and do what you do

I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love

Well it's late, and I want love
Love that's gonna break me in two
Don't hang me up in your doorway
Don't hang me up like you do
Come on, come on, come on and do it
Come on, and do what you do

I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
