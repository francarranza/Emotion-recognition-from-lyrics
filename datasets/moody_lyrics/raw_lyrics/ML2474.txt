Once
Is all I'll need to show you
Love making is an art
But once-made love
Won't be nearly enough
Once
I win your heart

Once
Upon a timeless romance
Love often was denied
But a thousand knights
Couldn't take me away
Once
I'm at your side

The world gets bigger as you look behind
Pouring in when you leave
You'll miss where you're going if you stare
I hope you're next to me
Watching it all go by
You'd get lost in all that world

Once
Just comes once in a lifetime
Then it becomes ago
All I ask is to kiss your lips
Once
And then you'll know
Once
And then you'll know
