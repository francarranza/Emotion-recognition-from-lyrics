A day in the life of a fool
A sad and a long, lonely day
I walk the avenue hoping I'll run into
The lovely sight of you coming my way

I stop right across from your door
But you don't see me anymore
So back to my room I go with a gloom
And I cry tears of goodbye

A day in the life of a fool
A sad and a long, lonely day
I walk the avenue hoping that I'll run into
The lovely sight of you coming my way

And I stop just across from your door
But you don't see me anymore
So back to my room I go with a gloom
And I cry tears of goodbye

Tears of goodbye
