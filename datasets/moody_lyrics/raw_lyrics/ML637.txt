No competition, I make you my decision, yeah

Every time I hear the music and I make a dip, a dip
Slave master comes around and spank I with his whip, the whip
But if I don't get my desire
Then I'll set the plantations in fire
My temperature is getting much higher
Got to get what I require

'Cause every time we do the work sometimes we are hurt, oh yeah
Boss never do a thing but hold on to his girth
But if I don't get my desire
Then I'll set the plantations in fire
My temperature is getting much higher
Got to get what I require

Every time I hear the music and I move my hip, my hip
Slave master comes around and spank I with his whip, a whip
Slave master, I'm the shepherd you're my pastor
Say you rock ?? so long we make the work
And if I don't get my desire
Then I'll set the station on fire
My temperature is getting much higher
Got to get what I require

But if I don't get my desire
Then I set the stations in fire
My temperature is getting much higher
Got to get what I require
