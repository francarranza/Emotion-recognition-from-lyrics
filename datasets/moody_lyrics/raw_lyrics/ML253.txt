If you sexy and you know it
And you sexy and you show it
Lemme see you get your hands in the air
If you sexy and you know it
And you sexy and you show it
Wave your hands like you just don't care

We don't need no clothes for this
They be on the floor for this
All up on the pole for this
Dropping down low for this
All up on the side with this
All between her thighs with this
Imagine how she ride with this
Wait 'til I'm inside with this oh, oh

I know it's turning you on, on
Didn't think it take us this long, long
To have our bodies going crazy to the beat of this song, oh

We get it on, ah ah all night long
To this sex music, sex music
Don't stop, that's it, right there, that's my shit
To this sex music, sex music

We got plenty time for this
All that's on my mind with this
All day on the grind for this
Ima make you mine to this
'Tron and a lime with this
Hope you get right to this
'Gon and close your eyes to this
Love the way you bite your nipple

I know it's turning you on, on
Didn't think it take us this long, long
To have our bodies going crazy to the beat of this song, oh no

We get it on, ah ah all night long
To this sex music, sex music
Don't stop, that's it, right there, that's my shit
To this sex music, sex music

Gurl I love your birthday suit
Sho' looks good on you
I just wanna lick you from head to toe
Ima having you screaming oh, oh
Baby take this ride,
Got me gased up all night
Push the petal down to the flo'
We got sex music on the radio

We get it on, ah ah all night long
To this sex music, sex music
Don't stop, that's it, right there, that's my shit
To this sex music, sex music

Sex, sex, sex music (oh oh oh)
Sex, sex, sex music (oh, ah, oh)
