I want to be a kid again
Combed down hair and Sunday best
See me staying out bunking school
Knowing wrong from right just rules

I wish I'd never seen your face
"Better door than window" phase
I need an echo, not your praise
Straying from the point you nailed

My mother, my mother, my mother never told
My mother, my mother, my mother never told me
Love is just a bloodsport
Love is just a bloodsport

'Cause love is just a bloodsport
Love is just a bloodsport

Sex and love is not a game
A game is something you can win
Maybe something kind of fun
'Cause love is just a bloodsport, son

My mother, my mother, my mother never told
My mother, my mother, my mother never told me

Never told me
Never told me

'Cause love is just a bloodsport
Love is just a bloodsport
'Cause love is just a bloodsport
Love is just a bloodsport

'Cause love is just a bloodsport
Love is just a bloodsport
'Cause love is just a bloodsport
Love is just a bloodsport
