I'm forgiven because you were forsaken
I'm accepted, you were condemned
I'm alive and well your spirit is within me
Because, you died and rose again

Amazing love, how can it be
That you, my king, would die for me
Amazing love, I know it's true
And it's my joy to honor you
In all I do, I honor you

You are my king
You are my king
Jesus, you are my king
You are my king
