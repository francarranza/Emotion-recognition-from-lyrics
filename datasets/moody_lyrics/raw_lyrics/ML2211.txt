Have a merry Christmas
And a happy new year
Give everyone your blessin'
And spread the good cheer
The best gift you can give
Is the gift of love
It's what the whole world needs
Is what we're dreaming of
So light up the fire
Walk through the snow
Come and stand with me now
Under the mistletoe

We all need some Christmas love
Gonna get my Christmas love
We all need some Christmas love

Children wrap your presents
Put them underneath the tree
If everybody gives
Then everyone receives
I see your pretty face
In the Christmas light
Children are excited
Cause Santa comes tonight

So light up the fire
Walk through the snow
Come and stand with me now
Under the mistletoe

We all need some Christmas love
Gonna get my Christmas love
We all need some Christmas love

Well I see Santa's been here
There's a smile on my face
He's brought all the presents
Put them right in their place
He's probably flyin' high
Across the moon
He'll be at your chimney
Any time soon

So light up the fire
Walk through the snow
Come and stand with me now
Under the mistletoe

We all need some Christmas love
Gonna get my Christmas love
We all need some Christmas love
That is what I'm thinkin' of
We all need some Christmas love

We all need some Christmas love
(Repeat 3 times)

Christmas love, all right
Mmm Christmas love, all right

We all need some Christmas love
