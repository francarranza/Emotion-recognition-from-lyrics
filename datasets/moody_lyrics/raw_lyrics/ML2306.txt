No sense at all
Do what you want
You will obey
For I will hunt you
Until you will be

Locked away

Just so you'll be
Scared of me
Behind my power
I will hide all my fears

Now you are punished
For absolutely nothing
And I feel so good
Because once more
I don't have to be honest

With myself
While you're locked away

Just so you'll be
Scared of me
Behind my power

I will hide all my fears
I will hide all my fears
