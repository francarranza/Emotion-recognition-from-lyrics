Here within my heart
The very deepest part
I kept to myself
But your love made me strong
And now my heart belongs 
To no one else
There's no one else

Only you
Can have the part of me
I gave to only you
No one else can love me
Just the way you do
No matter what we go through
Forever I love only you

There's something in your touch
That tells me just how much
You feel inside
You're not afraid to show
How far your love would go
There's no end in sight
So for all my life

Forever, forever
Only you
Can have the part of me
I gave to only you
No one else can love me
Just the way you do
No matter what we go through

Forever I love only you
Forever I love only you
Forever I love only you
