I opened up the bottle and I fell out of bed
I couldn't find the floor until it hit me in the head
I did a little powder off the bathroom sink
It's been about a month and something's starting to stink
Well, me and the band, we're starting to fight
'Cause if we got along, it just wouldn't feel right

We're the white trash circus...
Don't give a damn
We'll steal your girl whenever we can
We're the drunken gods of the living dead
We're the voice, we're the voice
We're the voice in your head
We're the trash, we're the trash
We're the trash in your bed

Been livin' on the road about a year and a half
If we go another mile, we're gonna kick each other's ass
Someone's gonna quit or someone's gonna die
And we don't give a shit because we're busy gettin' high
Another lawsuit, another arrest
We wouldn't change a thing because we love it to death

We're the white trash circus...
Don't give a damn
We'll steal your girl whenever we can
We're the drunken gods of the living dead
We're the voice, we're the voice
We're the voice in your head
We're the trash, we're the trash
We're the trash in your bed

We're the sons of the devil
We're the blood on the stage
You can love us; you can hate us
But we'll never go away...

We're the white trash circus...
Don't give a damn
We'll steal your girl whenever we can
We're the drunken gods of the living dead
We're the voice, we're the voice
We're the voice in your head

We're the white trash circus...
Don't give a damn
We'll steal your girl whenever we can
We're the drunken gods of the living dead

We're the voice, we're the voice
We're the voice in your head
We're the trash, we're the trash
We're the trash in your bed
