The first time that I saw you there
In my world, I wasn't prepared
And what I witnessed from your heart
'Cause I knew, baby girl, it was ready to start

My fantasy that was all so true
The way I felt, girl I knew
That you and me, we were meant to be
In this world for love, you were made for me

Oh wow, my fantasy girl
You're my fantasy girl
I need you tonight

Oh wow, my fantasy girl
You're my fantasy girl
I need you tonight

The way you look, the way you smile
You made me feel like a brand new guy inside
I want you in my fantasy
'Cause I'd do anything for you, don't you see

The way I feel, is oh so true
I can't deny what I'm telling you
Baby girl, in my fantasy
You would be more than happy, you would be with me

Oh wow, my fantasy girl
You're my fantasy girl
I need you tonight

Oh wow, my fantasy girl
You're my fantasy girl
I need you tonight
I want you, girl, tonight

Oh baby girl, what I'm trying to say
Is that I love you in almost every way
You are the one I've been searching for
In my life it seems you are my fantasy

Oh sweet love, won't you be mine?
I'll treat you like no other man has tried
I'll be your man, never let you down
And I'll always be true not to make you blue

Oh wow, my fantasy girl
You're my fantasy girl
I need you tonight

Oh wow, my fantasy girl
You're my fantasy girl
I need you tonight
I want you, girl, tonight
