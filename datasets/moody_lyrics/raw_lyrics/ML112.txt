Oh, I see what you've done to me.
The way you kill me and the way you rape me.
But I can't wait forever for someone to come help me.
As I can see us together, that's why I purge thee.

So I step down Jah Hell Fire.
Suckin up the blood of the land to change the evil ways of man.
So I step down Jah Hell Fire.
Send it as a warning to change your evil ways.
We send it as a warning to change your evil ways!

You think that I don't know of what you do.
You think that I don't know what you've gone through.
You don't see what you think of me,
And so my children, oh, when are you gonna see?

So I step down Jah Hell Fire.
Suckin up the blood of the land to change the evil ways of man.
So I step down Jah Hell Fire.
Send it as a warning to change your evil ways.

What you see and what you do
Will never be the same...

You think that I don't know of what you do.
You think that I don't know what you've gone through.
You don't see what you think of me,
And so my children, oh, when are you gonna see?

So I step down Jah Hell Fire.
Suckin up the blood of the land to change the evil ways of man.
So I step down Jah Hell Fire.
Send it as a warning to change your evil ways.
We send it as a warning to change your evil ways!

You're running away!
You're running away!
Don't worry son, thinks spark from this fire.
You can't run from Jah love.

Oh, Hell Fire!
Oh, Hell Fire!
Oh, Hell Fire!
