Down the stairs to the stone house
Golden light, oh what a fight
Another sleepless night, her dress is filigree
She tells me all her secrets then I'm back on the street

It's hard, oh it's hard to help yourself
When you don't know where to begin
It's the devil, it's the boil, it's the black of night
In your head, in your head

Do you see the fire heavy lit before its time?
Know you the color of the end of the end of the end
Silence is dancing to a beating drum
Money is nothing but a loaded gun

And it's hard, oh it's hard to help yourself
When you don't know where to begin
It's the devil, it's the boil, it's the black of night
In your head, in your head

It's hard, oh it's hard to help yourself
When you don't know where to begin
It's the devil, it's the boil, it's the black of night
In your head, in your head

And it's hard, oh it's hard to help yourself
When you don't know where to begin
In the midst of a moment can you break the boy?
Can you tame the demon?

Light a candle in the dark, in the dark, in dark
In the dark, light a candle in the dark, in dark
In dark, in dark, oh in the dark, light a candle in the dark
In dark, in dark, in dark
