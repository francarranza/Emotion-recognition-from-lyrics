I have told you things need to change 
You never listened or came to my aid 
The vicious cycle has not changed 
My time's spent rearranged 

Motherfuck it all 
I can't stand this 
Remember when I said 
Everyone makes me sick 
Well nothing has changed 

I hate everyone 
I hate everyone 

This vicious cycle still remains 
Constant clusterfuck, bloodstains 
Ignorance, you kill for God 
Expression not allowed 

You fucked it up 
With your motherfucking games 
Remember when I said 
I was so ashamed 
Well nothing has changed 

I hate everyone 
I hate everyone 

You have to 
Pick and choose your fights 
You have to 
Come out of this alive 

I have told you things neeed to change 
You never listened or came to my aid 
The vicious cycle still not changed 
My judgment fades away 

You'll never change me 
Remember we are through 
I am staying here 
To betray all of you 
And nothing will change 

I hate everyone 
I hate everyone 
I hate everyone 
I hate, and I hate, and I hate everyone
