You, you're hotter than a cherry on a cigarette
Bet every dollar mom's a model but you're better yet
Just 21 out on the run and turning every head
Your body's built just like a weapon and you're using it

But the devil can hear you when you say

C'mon and get up (Get up)
Move your body, use your body
Lose Control

Rub it right up (Back up)
Against my body
Take my body; make it yours (So get up)
We're gonna light this room on fire
Yeah you and I will burn it up tonight (So get up)
The two of us are gonna fuel this fire
No way in hell we're slowing down tonight

And just for fun we take your tongue and run it over my lip
You gotta love the way she does it for the hell of it
We're in positions that most people only say they know
You've got your hand right on a landmine ready to blow

But the devil can hear you when you say

C'mon and get up (Get up)
Move your body, use your body
Lose Control

Rub it right up (Back up)
Against my body
Take my body; make it yours (So get up)
We're gonna light this room on fire
Yeah you and I will burn it up tonight (So get up)
The two of us are gonna fuel this fire
No way in hell we're slowing down tonight

You want me tapping on your back door
You've got me tapping on your back door, baby
I've got you acting like you want more
Now that I'm tapping on your back door, baby

But the devil can hear you when you say

C'mon and get up (Get up)
Move your body, use your body
Lose Control

Rub it right up (Back up)
Against my body
Take my body; make it yours (So get up)
We're gonna light this room on fire
Yeah you and I will burn it up tonight (So get up)
The two of us are gonna fuel this fire
No way in hell we're slowing down tonight
