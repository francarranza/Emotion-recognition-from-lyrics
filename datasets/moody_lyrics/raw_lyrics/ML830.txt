Okay, I've got it
We can do what we want to do
Touch me right here

Set the night to music
Set the night to music

Look at all the stars tonight
Look at all the moonlight
Look at us, we're all alone
Oh, and it's just like a dream
Like some romantic fantasy
Darling, come and hold me close

We could be making love
And with the slightest touch
We could

Set the night to music, we could
Set the night to music, we could
Do what we want to do
It'll only take me and you t0
Set the night to music
Yeah, yeah

We'll find a rhythm all our own
Melt into it nice and slow
Love ourselves away from here, mm
With your heart beating next to mine
Perfect love in perfect time
Watch the world just disappear

This moment is our to take
And with the love we make
We could

Set the night to music, we could
Set the night to music, we could
Do what we want to do
It'll only take me and you to
Set the night to music
Yeah, yeah

Whoa, oh, ho
Whoa, oh, ho
Yeah, yeah, oh-ho
Whoa, oh, ho
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, ah yeah

This moment is ours to take (this moment is ours)
And with the love we make (the love that we make)
And with the slightest touch
We could

Set the night to music, we could
Set the night to music, we could
Do what we want to do
It'll only take me and you to
Set the night to music (to music) yeah
