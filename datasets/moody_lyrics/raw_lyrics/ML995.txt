When I was a young boy
My momma said to me
Once a woman gets your soul
You'll never shake her free
These are words of wisdom
It turns out she was right
Gotta find a lover
'Cause I need a fix tonight

(Whoooooo)
Watch it touch me deep inside
(Whoooooo)
Somethin' snaps inside my mind
(Whoooooo)
When I feel it comin' ain't no sense in runnin'

I'm addicted to that rush
Every time we touch
Never get enough
'Cause I'm addicted to that rush, yeow!

Look around I stop and stare
Got to get a taste
Pretty women everywhere
We ain't got time to waste
Lookin' for a little thang
To fit into my plans
On the town I'll hurt you down
I'm walkin' like a man

(Whoooooo)
Watch it touch me deep inside
(Whoooooo)
Somethin' snaps inside my mind
(Whoooooo)
When I feel it comin' ain't no sense in runnin'

I'm addicted to that rush
Every time we touch
Never get enough
'Cause I'm addicted to that rush, one more
I'm addicted to that rush
Every time we touch
Never get enough
'Cause I'm addicted to that rush

(Whoooooo)
Watch it touch me deep inside
(Whoooooo)
Somethin' snaps inside my mind
(Whoooooo)
When I feel it comin' ain't no sense in runnin'

Once I thought her lovin'
Was a habit I could break
But when I go without it
My body starts to ache

I'm addicted to that rush
Every time we touch
Never get enough
'Cause I'm addicted to that rush
Never, never, never, never, never, get enough

(Whoooooo)
Watch it touch me deep inside
(Whoooooo)
Somethin' snaps inside my mind
(Whoooooo)
When I feel it comin', ain't no sense in runnin'

I'm addicted to that rush
Addicted to that rush
I'm addicted to that rush
Addicted to that rush
I'm addicted to that rush
I'm addicted to that rush
Addicted to that rush
I'm addicted to that rush
