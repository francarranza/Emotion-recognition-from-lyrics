Out of the blue into my heart
Wasn't expecting you so soon but
I'm so glad you're here in my life
Now everything is gonna be alright

Out of the blue straight from my dreams
Unselfish love is what you bring
Boy, I'm so glad you're here in my life
Now everything is gonna be alright

Just because you came along
My heart was singing all sad love songs
(Deep waters)
Each and every passing day
I would pray that you would come my way

Was feeling weak but I stayed strong
Strong enough just to hold on to
Witness the answer to my prayer
And like a bolt of lightning

Now that I have you here with me
My heart is singing a joyful melody
I never had a love so rare
So whenever you go I will be there

Now that I have you here with me
My heart is singing a joyful melody
I never had a love so rare
So whenever you go I will be there

Out of confusion, pain and despair
The universe has finally answered my prayer
And sent me an angel from above
(Yeah)

Full of joy, happiness and love
Eyes so beautiful
(So beautiful)
I love you
(I love you)

Now that I have you here with me
My heart is singing a joyful melody
I never had a love so rare
So whenever you go I will be there

So sad, you're here with me
Baby, I love you
So glad, you're here with me
Baby, I love you
So glad, you're here with me
Baby, I love you
