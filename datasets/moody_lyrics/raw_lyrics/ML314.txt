Dance
It's all I wanna do, so won't you dance?
I'm standing here with you, why won't you move?
I'll get inside your groove, 'cause I'm on fire, fire, fire, fire
It hurts
When you get too close, but baby, it hurts
If love is really good, you just want more
Even if it throws you to the fire, fire, fire, fire

All the lovers
That have gone before
They don't compare
To you
Don't be frightened
Just give me a little bit more
They don't compare
All the lovers

Feel
Can't you see there's so much here to feel?
Deep inside your heart you know I'm real
Can't you see that this is getting higher, higher, higher, higher
Breathe
I know you find it hard, but baby, breathe
You being next to me, it's all you need
And I'll take you there, I'll take you higher, higher, higher, higher

All the lovers
That have gone before
They don't compare
To you
Don't be frightened (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just give me a little bit more (more)
They don't compare (yeah, yeah, yeah)
All the lovers

Dance
It's all I wanna do, so won't you dance?
I'm standing here with you, why won't you move?
Even if it throws you to the fire, fire, fire, fire (fire, fire, fire, fire)

(Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire)

All the lovers (yeah, yeah, yeah)
That have gone before (more)
They don't compare (yeah, yeah, yeah)
To you
Don't be frightened (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just give me a little bit more (more)
They don't compare
All the lovers
