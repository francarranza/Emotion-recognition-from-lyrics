While she waits, she holds her breath
And thinks about the things we said
And takes the modern song she knows
But now and then a hollow ghost

And everything she says she can fall for
She goes on so no one will know
Everything that she says she can fall for
She knows she'll be there on her own
And everything she says she can fall for
She goes on so no one will know
Everything she says she can fall for
She knows she'll be there on her own
And everything that she says she can fall for
She goes and she'll fall on her own
And everything that she says she can fall for
She goes and she'll fall on her own
