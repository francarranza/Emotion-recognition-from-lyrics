I've been lonely for so long
Don't seem like happiness will come along
I've been lonely for so long
Don't seem like happiness will come along

These ain't rain clouds over my head
Everybody's throwing rocks in my bed
Just can't seem to get ahead in life
Ooh, nothin' I do ever turn out for the right

Won't somebody help me please

'Cause I've been lonely for so long
Don't seem like happiness will come along
I've been lonely for so long
Don't seem like happiness will come along

I lay awake every night
Tryin' to figure out how to make things right
There's got to be a better way I know
To shake this monkey off 'cause he's makin' me so

Won't somebody help me please

'Cause I've been ooh, lonely for so long
Don't seem like happiness will come along
I've been lonely so long
Don't seem like happiness will come along

Yes, I know what it feels like to be lonely
To have your friends turn their backs on you
To never know the real meaning
Of peace of mind, oh

Just can't seem to get ahead in life
Ooh, nothin' I do ever turn out for the right

Won't somebody help me please

'Cause I've been lonely for so long
Don't seem like happiness will come along
I've been lonely for so long
Don't seem like happiness will come along

I've been down so long
I've been down so long
I've been down so long
I've been down so long

I get lonely, I get lonely
I get lonely, I get lonely
I get lonely, lonely
