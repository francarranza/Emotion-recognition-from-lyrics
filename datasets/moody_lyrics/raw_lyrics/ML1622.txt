Baby, when I think about you
I think about love
And darlin', gonna live without you
And your love
And if I had those golden dreams of my yesterday
I would wrap you
In the heavens
And feel it dying dying dying all the way

Well I feel like makin'

I Feel like makin' love
(Love love love)
I Feel like makin' love
(Love love love)
I Feel like makin' love
(Love love love)
Feel like makin' love to you

Baby, if I think about you
I think about love
And darlin', if I had to live without you
I live without love
And if I had the sun and moon
And they were shinin
I would give you both night and day
Love satisfying

Well I Feel like makin'

I Feel like makin' love
(Love love love)
I Feel like makin' love
(Love love love)
I Feel like makin' love
(Love love love)
Feel like makin' love to you

And if I had those golden dreams of my yesterday
I would wrap you
In the heavens
Feel it dying dying dying all the way

I Feel like makin'

I Feel like makin' love
(Love love love)
I Feel like makin' love
(Love love love)
I Feel like makin' love
(Love love love)
Feel like makin' love to you
