I can't see the clouds for the colours,
For the rainbow's covered my view
Again I turn around and there's another rainbow coming from you
But it won't be long till I get home
To see in your eyes and discover

(What do) they know what you go through
You bring the sun, I brought the water, brought the rainbows still coming from you
But it won't be long till I get home
Rainbows
