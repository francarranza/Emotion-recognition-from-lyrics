Yeah, I'm exstatic forlove
Fanatic of love
And if I'm not around
It's you I'm thinkin' of
I'm gonna make it real for you
Whenever I deal wit you
I do do do do anything

I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find the love within
So I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go
My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well I'm in a daze from your love you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go
Some people go around the world for love
But they may never find what they dream of
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything
But you won't give up
In my world only you
Make me do for love
What I would not do
Do for love
You tried everything
Won't give up
My friends wonder what is wrong with me
'Cause I'm in a daze from your love you see
So I came back to let you know
I got a thing for you
And I can't let go
And though I only want the best it's true
I can't believe the things I do for you
What you won't do, do for love
You've tried everything
But you don't give up
In my world only you
Make me do for love
What I would not do

Yeah, come on now, listen
Do they get it when the project is a queen
I gotta get to you cause you do them things to me
My love shows
Nobody knows how my ???
'Cause when you're filling me up
You're enough when you're ready for that nut
Baby I'll be that buttercup
And I catch every drop
You got a chick of love
For you go to the storm
And skip to the road block
We can rumble in cuss
We can fight
We can fuss
But no I'm never giving up
It's nothing I won't do
Nothing I won't go through
You are of the joy and the pain
I will keep it true

What you won't do
Do for love
You tried everything
But you won't give up
In my world only you
Make me do for love
What I would not do

Do for love
You tried everything
Won't give up
Do for love
You tried everything
Won't give up
