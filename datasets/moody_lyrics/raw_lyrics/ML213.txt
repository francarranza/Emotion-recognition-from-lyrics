I will break into your thoughts
With what's written on my heart
I will break
Break

I'm so sick, infected with
Where I live, let me live
Without this empty bliss, selfishness
I'm so sick
I'm so sick

If you want more of this
We can push out, sell out, die out
So you'll shut up 
And stay sleeping
With my screaming in your itching ears

I'm so sick, infected with
Where I live, let me live
Without this empty bliss, selfishness
I'm so sick
I'm so sick

Hear it, I'm screaming it
You're heeding to it now
Hear it, I'm screaming it
You tremble at this sound

You sink into my clothes
This invasion makes me feel worthless, hopeless, sick

I'm so sick, infected with
Where I live, let me live
Without this empty bliss, selfishness
I'm so
I'm so sick

I'm so sick, infected with
Where I live, let me live
Without this empty bliss, selfishness
I'm so 
I'm so sick 
I'm so 
I'm so sick
