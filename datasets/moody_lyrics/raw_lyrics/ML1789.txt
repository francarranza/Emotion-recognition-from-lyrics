Man, you got a lot of jokes to tell
So you throw your baby's pennies down the well
Give a little more than you like
Pick apart the past, you're not going back
Don't you waste your time
No, oh, oh, oh

Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a

Sure, you've got a handle on the past
It's why you keep your little lovers in your lap
Give a little more than you like
Pick apart the past, you're not going to last
So don't you waste your time
No, oh, oh, oh

Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a

Hoping for the last ship to arrive
I've been blessed with a kingdom, half-mine

Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a
