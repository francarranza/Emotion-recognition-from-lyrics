I am leaving you because I don't love you
I am leaving you because I don't love you

Oh, it's the knowledge
It's the knowledge
It's the knowledge
Of future clarity
That makes my voice tremble
With greater dignity

I am leaving you because I don't love you
I am leaving you because I don't love you

I'm sorry I have to be this brutally honest, Nicole
But my excuses were babies of snow that I just could not hold
So you pick up your asthma inhaler and put it 'gainst your lips
Oh, those lips I've loved, that I was dreaming of
They're still red and soft, I'm so sorry I couldn't love you enough
I'm so sorry I couldn't love you enough
I'm so sorry

But I'm leaving you because I don't love you
I am leaving you because I don't love you

So you pick up your asthma inhaler and put it 'gainst your lips
Oh, those lips I've loved, that I was dreaming of
They're still red and soft, I'm so sorry I couldn't love you enough
So sorry I couldn't love you enough
I'm so sorry
