Last night we went to bed not talkin'
'Cause we'd already said too much
I faced the wall, you faced the window
Bound and determined not to touch

We've been married seven years now
Some days it feels like twen'y-one
I'm still mad at you this morning
Coffee's ready if you want some
I've been up since five
Thinking 'bout me and you
And I've got to tell you
The conclusion I've come to

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile
I just wanna be mad for a while

For now, you might as well forget it
Don't run your fingers through my hair
Yeah, that's right, I'm being stubborn
No, I don't wanna go back upstairs
I'm going to leave for work
Without a goodbye kiss
But as I'm driving off
Just remember this

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile
I just wanna be mad for a while

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile
I just wanna be mad for a while
I just wanna be mad for a while
I just wanna be mad for a while
I just wanna be mad for a while
