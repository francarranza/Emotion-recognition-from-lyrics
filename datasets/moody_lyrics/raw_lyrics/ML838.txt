You spurn my natural emotions
You make me feel like dirt and I'm hurt
And if I start a commotion
I run the risk of losing you and that's worse

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love in love with someone
Ever fallen in love in love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with

I can't see much of a future
Unless we find out what's to blame what a shame
And we won't be together much longer
Unless we realize that we are the same

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love in love with someone
Ever fallen in love in love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with

You disturb my natural emotions
You make me feel like dirt and I'm hurt
And if I start a commotion
I run the risk of losing you and that's worse

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love in love with someone
Ever fallen in love in love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love in love with someone
Ever fallen in love in love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with

Break

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love in love with someone
Ever fallen in love in love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love in love with someoone you shouldn't've
Fallen in love with...
