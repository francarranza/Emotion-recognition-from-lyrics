I'm not the hero out the gate
So much to feel, so much to gain
My higher reason will take aim
I'll be okay, I've got my shapes
We are not alone, we share our stake
And I think the winter will be wonderful

I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without

Go alone, we'll spread the chase
To all the roller copter way
There's no allegiance left to take
These great big sheets disintegrate
You don't wanna, you don't wanna

I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without

I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without

But I feel this way
Feel this way
I steal, I heal, I do it again
Over and over and over and over
