Eurus
Afer Ventus

So the world goes round and round
With all you ever knew -
They say the sky high above
Is Caribbean blue

If every man says all he can
If every man is true
Do I believe the sky above
Is Caribbean blue

Boreas
Zephryus

If all you told was turned to gold
If all you dreamed was new
Imagine sky high above
In Caribbean blue
