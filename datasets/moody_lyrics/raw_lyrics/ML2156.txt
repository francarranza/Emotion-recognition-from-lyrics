Lay down your arms (soldier of love)
And surrender to me
Lay down your arms (soldier of love)
And love me peacefully, yeah

Use your arms for loving me
Baby that's the way it's got to be

Mm, there ain't no reason for you to declare
War on the one who loves you so

So forget the other boys, cause my love is real
Come off your battlefield

Lay down your arms (soldier of love)
And surrender to me
Lay down your arms (soldier of love)
And love me peacefully, yeah

Use your arms to squeeze and please
I'm the one who loves you so

The weapons you're using
Are hurting me bad
But someday you're gonna be true
Cause my love baby
Is the truest you've ever had
I'm a soldier of love that's hard to beat

Lay down your arms (soldier of love)
And surrender to me
Lay down your arms (soldier of love)
And surrender to me, yeah

Use your arms to hold me tight
Baby I don't wanna fight no more
(Soldier of love)
Baby lay down your arms yep yep...
Baby lay down your arms
Soldier of love
Baby lay down your arms
