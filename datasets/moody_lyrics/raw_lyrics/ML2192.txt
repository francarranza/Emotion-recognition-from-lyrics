I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinkin' about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same dear if you're not here with me

And when the blue snowflakes start fallin'
That's when the blue memories start callin'
You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white
And I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white
And I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
And I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
And I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.
