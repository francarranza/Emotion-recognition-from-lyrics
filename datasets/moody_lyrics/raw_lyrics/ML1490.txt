Tell me, tell me
Is life just a playground?
Think you're the real deal, honey?
And someone will always look out for you?

But wake up, baby
You're so totally deluded
You'll end up old and lonely
If you don't get a bullet in your head

Good luck, good luck
Good luck in your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares, honey
When you're resting your head

Good luck, good luck
Good luck in your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares, honey
When you're resting your head

You sold me, sold me
You sold me down the river now
I hope you're feeling happy now
Now you always have a sneer in your smile

But wake up, baby
You're so totally deluded
You'll end up old and lonely
If you don't get a bullet in your head

Good luck, good luck
Good luck in your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares, honey
When you're resting your head

Good luck, good luck
Good luck in your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares, honey
When you're resting your head

And I'm glad, so glad, that I'm done with you
No more crying, crying
Leaving me so black and blue
You backed me up against the wall
But I stand tall, don't give a damn no more
Oh, baby, bye bye

No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
Without you

Good good luck
In your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares
When you're resting your head

Good, good luck
In your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares

Good luck, good luck
Good luck in your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares, honey
When you're resting your head

Good luck, good luck
Good luck in your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares, honey
When you're resting your head

Good luck, good luck (good luck)
Good luck in your new bed (good luck)
Enjoy your nightmares, honey (good luck)
When you're resting your head (good luck)

Good luck, good luck (good luck)
Good luck in your new bed (good luck)
Enjoy your nightmares, honey (good luck)
When you're resting your head (good luck)

Good, good luck
In your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares
When you're resting your head

Good, good luck
In your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares
