I am the God of Hell fire and I bring you

Fire, I'll take you to burn
Fire, I'll take you to learn
I'll see you burn

You fought hard and you saved and earned
But all of it's going to burn
And your mind, your tiny mind
You know you've really been so blind
Now 's your time burn your mind
You're falling far too far behind

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
You're gonna burn

Fire, to destroy all you've done
Fire, to end all you've become
I'll feel you burn

You've been living like a little girl
In the middle of your little world
And your mind, your tiny mind
You know you've really been so blind
Now's your time to burn your mind
You're falling far too far behind

Fire, I'll take you to burn
Fire, I'll take you to learn
I'll see you burn

You're gonna burn
You're gonna burn
You're gonna burn
Burn
Burn
Burn
Burn
Burn
Burn

Fire, I'll take you to burn
Fire, I'll take you to learn
Fire, I'll take you to burn
Fire, I'll take you to learn
