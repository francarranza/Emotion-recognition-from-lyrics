London
Quieten down I need to make a sound
New York
Quieten down I need to make a sound
Kingston
Quieten down I need to make a sound
Brazil
Quieten down I need to make a sound

They're coming through the window
They're coming through the door
They're busting down the big wall
And sounding the horn [x2]

What you Want
Bucky Done Gun
What you want
That Fire Done Burn
What you want
Bucky Done Gun
Get Crackin' Get Get Crackin' [x2]

Time to spit new shit
I'm rocking on this new bit
I'm hot now you'll see
I'll fight you just to get peace

Heavy weight wrestler
Fight me in your comforter
Let you be superior
I'm filth with the fury ya

London
Quieten down I need to make a sound
New York
Quieten down I need to make a sound
Kingston
Quieten down I need to make a sound
Brazil
Quieten down I need to make a sound

I'll hard drive your bit
I'm battered by your sumo grip
Lucky I like feeling shit
My Stamina can take it
Gymnastics Super Fit
Muscle in the gun clip
Bite, Teeth Nose Bleed
Tied up in a scarf piece

What you Want
Bucky Done Gun
What you want
That Fire Done Burn
What you want
Bucky Done Gun
Get Crackin' Get Get Crackin' [x2]

Can I get control
Do you like me vulnerable
I'm armed and I'm equal
More fun for the people
Physical, brute force
Steel, iron you're the boss
Yeah, you're so do-able
Grind me down sugar salt

What you Want
Bucky Done Gun
What you want
That Fire Done Burn
What you want
Bucky Done Gun
Get Crackin' Get Get Crackin' [x2]
