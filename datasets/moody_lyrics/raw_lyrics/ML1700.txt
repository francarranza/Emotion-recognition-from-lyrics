Hey, signs
Signs are lost
Signs disappear
Turn invisible
Got no sign
Somebody got busted
Got a face of stone
And a ghostwritten biography
Dogs start to rush in
Hungry for some food
Dogs start a-twitching
And they're looking at you
It was light
By five
Torn all apart
All in the name of democracy
He's hurt
He's dying
Claimed he was a terrorist
Claimed to avert a catastrophe
Someone shoulda told him
That the buck stops here
No one ever said
He was involved with thieves

And they're blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind

No sense of harmony
No sense of time
Don't mention harmony
Say what is it, what is it, what is it?
Give a little shock
And he raises his hand
Somebody shouts out
Say what is it, what is it, what is it?
He was shot down in the night
People ride by, but his body's still alive
Girl in the window, what has she done?
She looks down at me
Says, "I don't want to die"

And I'm blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind

Somebody could have told us where they go
Crawling all around
Looking for foot, foot, footprints
Now tell me, what the hell have we become?
Some dirty little bastards
What the hell is going on?
No sense of harmony
No sense of time
Don't mention harmony
Say what is it, what is it, what is it?
Give a little shock
And he raises his hand
Somebody shouts out
Say what is it, what is it, what is it?
He was shot down in the night
People ride by, but his body's still alive
Girl in the window, what has she done?
She looks down at me
Says, "I don't want to die"

She's blind, and they're blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Whoo, blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Yeah, they're blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
