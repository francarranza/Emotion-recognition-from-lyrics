In the end
There can be only laughter
After the dance
Lies a whole new chapter
So never wait too long to try
Cause you might
You might win
Love is all that we're after
Though we pretend
There's much more to capture
These are sacred days
Let's make room for each other
And let love have its way
Have your fill of it's wonder
But never hold on too tight
And you might
You might win 
So never wait too long to try
And you might you might win
Never wait too long to try
And you might win you might win
Never wait too long to try
Cause you might win
