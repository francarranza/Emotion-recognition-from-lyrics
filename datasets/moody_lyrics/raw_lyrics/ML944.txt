You are the love of my life
And you are the reason I'm alive
And baby baby baby
When I think of how you saved me
I go crazy

I've never known love like this
And it fills me with a new tenderness
And I know I know I know
You're in my heart, You're in my soul
You're all I can't resist

And I need to tell you
The first time I held you I knew
You are the love of my life

I spent a lifetime waiting
Always hesitating until you
I was lost so deep inside my shell
Till you came and saved me from myself
Now all I really know is I need you

And you are the love of my life
All the joy and tears that I cry
And baby baby baby
You don't have to say a word
I see it in your eyes

As we stand together
I promise forever till the day that I die
You are the love of my life

I spent a lifetime waiting
Always hesitating until you
I was lost so deep inside my shell
Till you came and saved me from myself
Now all I really know is I need you

You are the love of my life
And you are the reason I'm alive
