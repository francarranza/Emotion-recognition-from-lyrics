You can give me money, diamonds and pearls
But you can't buy my love for no money in the world

You can't buy my love, no you can't buy my love
For no money in the world you can't buy my love

Now you're so blue, baby I'm so glad
Because you done lost, the best thing you ever had

You can't buy my love, no you can't buy my love
For no money in the world you can't buy my love

Now you're so blue, baby I'm so glad
Because you done lost, the best thing you ever had

You can't buy my love, no you can't buy my love
For no money in the world you can't buy my love
