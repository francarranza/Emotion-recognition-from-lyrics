Walk you to the counter
(What you got to offer?)
Pick you out a soda
(Look at you forever)
Walk you to the water
(Your eyes like a casino)
We ain't born typical

Find a piece of silver
(Pretty as a diagram)
And go down to the Rio
(Put it in my left hand)
Put it in a fruit machine
(Everyone's a winner)
Laughin' like a seagull

You are a fever, you are a fever
You ain't born typical

Livin' in a suitcase
(Meet a clown, fall in love)
Went down to have you over
(Going 'round a breakup)
Take you to a jukebox
(That's the situation)
Pick you out a number
(And that's our arrangement)

Dancing on the legs of a newborn pony
Left-right, left-right
Keep it up, son
Go ahead and have her, go ahead and leave her
You only ever had her when you were a fever

I am a fever, I am a fever
I ain't born typical

We are a fever, we are a fever
We ain't born typical
