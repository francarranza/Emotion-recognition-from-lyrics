I ain't no more to try
And you don't care I say
I never friggin' try
I'll never fuck this time

That I don't want more
And you just try
Yeah I don't want more
It's no fun
It's no fun
It's no fun
It's no fun

I should a known this time its
I think you know my path
I know what it's like
That its worth a piece of trash
