Love
Love can Move Mountains

There ain't a dream
That don't have the chance
To come true now
It just takes a little faith, baby
Anything that we want to do
We can do now
There ain't nothing in our way, baby
Nothing our love couldn't rise above
We can get through the night
We can get to the light
Long as we got our love to
Light the way

With a little faith
Just a little trust
If you believe in love
Love can move mountains
Believe in your heart
And feel, feel it in your soul
And love, love can
Love can move mountains

Oceans deep and mountains high
They can't stop us
Because love is on our side baby
We can reach the heavens and
Touch the sky
Just believe it, believe in you and I, baby
If we got love that is strong enough
We can do anything, we'd get
Through anything
'Cause through it all love will always
Find a way

Just a little faith
Just a little trust
If you believe in love
Love can move mountains
Believe in your heart
And feel, feel it in your soul
And love, baby, love can
Love can move mountains

You got to feel it, baby

You believe in me
I believe in you
If we believe in each other
Nothing we can't do
If we got love that is strong enough
We can do anything, make it through anything
'Cause through it all
Love will always find a way

Just a little faith
Just a little trust
If you believe in love
Love can move mountains
Believe in your heart
And feel, feel it in your soul
And love, love can move mountains

Love will find a way
Love will find a way, baby
Believe in each other
Oh, baby
Believe in love
Love can move mountains

Believe if your feeling love
Loooooove
You got to feel it
You gotta you gotta you gotta you gotta you gotta you gotta feel it baby
