Can't buy me love, money can't buy me love
Can't buy me love, money can't buy me love
Can't buy me love, buy me love

Listen
I'll buy you a diamond ring, my friend
If it makes you feel alright
I'll get you anything, my friend
If it makes you feel alright

I'll give you all I've got to give
If you say you love me too
I don't care too much for money
Cause money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love, money can't buy me love
Can't buy me love, money can't buy me love
Buy me love, buy me love
Money can't buy me

You say you don't want them diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy

I may not have a lot to gift
But what I've got I'll gift to you
I don't care too much for money
Cause money can't buy you love

Can't buy me love, money can't buy me love
Can't buy me love, money can't buy me love
Can't buy me love, money can't buy me love
Can't buy me love, money can't buy me love

Buy me love, buy me love, buy me love
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Can't buy me love
