"The Fire"

I'm gonna say it like I mean it,
We've let this go on to long.
You know I'm starting to believe it
That all together we could be strong
I won't name who's to blame for the misery and pain
It's a shame all the same that we
Lay down and play their game.

You've got it wrong,
It's not all right
We've got the fire, but does it mean anything
We've got the fire tonight.
We wanna fight but will that change anything?
Will it make it all right?

I know it's vague but I'll say it
There's something wrong everywhere
And you're ashamed to admit it
But if it's not then you don't care
Well they will put you away
For the things that you say
And you're not buying in,
But their still gonna make you pay

You've got it wrong,
It's not all right
We've got the fire, but it doesn't mean anything
We've got the fire tonight
We wanna fight but will it change anything?
Will that make it all right?
