I used to think that I was happy
But I was just lying to myself
Made me believe no one would have me
So I put my poor heart on the shelf

Like a heatwave
Like a sud-den wind
Like a slap to the essence of my being
Boy you came in, like a sud-den wind
You know you blew me away
Away

Will you love me
Will you be-the-one
Who is coming, coming to my rescue
Will you care for me
Will you comfort me
Will you be the one
The one who's gonna rescue me

I feel like I was born just for you
I am so glad you came in time
Now that your here
I just adore you baby
To lose this love would be a crime

Like a heatwave
Like a sud-den wind
Like a slap to the essence of my being
Boy you came in, like a sud-den wind
You know you blew me away
Away

Will you love me
Will you be the one
Who is coming, coming to my rescue
Will you care for me
Will you com-fort me
Will you be the one
The one who's gonna rescue me

Will you love me
Will you be the one
Who is coming, coming to my rescue
Will you care for me
Will you com-fort me
Will you be the one
The one who's gonna rescue me

Will you love me
Will you love me
Will you love me
Will you love me
Will you love me
Will you love me
Will you love me
Will you love me

Will you love me
Will you be the one
Who is coming, coming to my rescue
Will you care for me
Will you com-fort me
Will you be the one
The one who's gonna rescue me
