I am not the same,
Everything's been different since the day
You came into my life
You will never change,
You'll always be the truth the life the way
You came into my life

Pre:
I will not forget, Your love and faithfulness
Jesus You are the difference in my life
The joy I cannot hide
Savior I'll show the world what You have done
All that I've become, I'm not The same!
