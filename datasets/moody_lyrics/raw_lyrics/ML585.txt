I'll never smile again
Until I smile at you
I'll never laugh again
What good would it do?

For tears would fill my eyes
My heart would realize
That our romance is through

I'll never love again
I'm so in love with you
I'll never thrill again
To somebody new

Within my heart
I know I will never start
To smile again, until I smile at you

Within my heart
I know I will never start
To smile again, until I smile at you

Until I smile at you
