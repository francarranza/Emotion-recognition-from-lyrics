Don't get me wrong, I wanna be your friend
And lay your crazy paving from end to end to end to end
I've heard your stupid stories, I know that some are true
Oh, wild horses are running through your eyes of blue

Loneliness only makes me high
Loneliness only makes me wanna hold on
Loneliness only makes me high
Loneliness only makes me wanna hold on

I wanna take you there, have the time of your life
I'm gonna lift you up to where the drinks are free, to the
Party in the sky (wanna hold on)
Party in the sky (wanna hold on)
The party in the sky, the party in the sky

Loneliness only makes me high
Loneliness only makes me wanna hold on
Loneliness only makes me high
Loneliness only makes me wanna hold on
To a good thing that's gone bad
And I'm building my house on sand

Don't get me wrong, I wanna be your friend
And lay your crazy paving from end to end to end to end
I've heard your stupid stories, I know that some are true
Oh, wild horses are running through your eyes of blue

Loneliness only makes me high
Loneliness only makes me wanna hold on
Loneliness only makes me high
Loneliness only makes me wanna hold on
To a good thing that's gone bad
And I'm building my house on sand
