Those tire tracks
Zigzag your torso like a Devil's self portrait

The car accident
The skin graft treatment
The flower baskets
The wincing relatives

You bid her farewell then got in your car
And that's the last thing that you can recall

And when they pulled you out
You didn't know your name
Exploding semi-truck
Blurred your face with flame

You met Jane four years ago today
Dancing at some vomit-stained frat party

Her newspaper gown
A flashing headline brown
Her violent gypsy dance
Her tired underpants

A love, love, love, love, love, love
A love, love, love, love, love, love
Rhymes with pity now

A love, love, love, love, love, love
A love, love, love, love, love, love
Rhymes with sympathy

And Jane let you touch and feel her
And she was so free like a pineapple in a tree, but

You said it's dangerous
To be so intimate
You know it's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous

And Jane said when she laid on her back
The sun hit her body like an ugly landscape, but

Some things never get better
Like used cars and bad livers
So you traded her in
For a better looking brand

One with fake porno tits
A pad lock on her lips
Disposable tan
Biodegradable hands

And back at the hospital
You got no visitors at all
She visits you in your sleep
But that newspaper gown (But you wanted)
Is always on fire (But you wanted)

And back at the hospital
You got no visitors at all
She visits you in your sleep
But that newspaper gown (But you wanted)
Is always on fire (But you wanted)

She met him a week
After you left her
When you tossed out her touch
To the garbage collector

He talked her out of her skirt
In his beer-soaked apartment
And then they did all the things you
Said that you wanted

And the sirens are laughing
Underneath your skull
And your thoughts are turning
Dull, callous and cold

Yesterday you gave
Your burden a name
Yesterday you gave
Your burden a face

But your burden
It looks a lot like her

A love, love, love, love, love, love
A love, love, love, love, love, love
Rhymes with pity now

A love, love, love, love, love, love
A love, love, love, love, love, love
Rhymes with sympathy now

A love, love, love, love, love, love
A love, love, love, love, love, love
