Dang the sun; dang this day 
An' I'm just tryin' to stay outta your danged ol' way 
To heck with this; to heck with us 
An' shoot if I'll ever look back on where I've been 
Shoot if I'll ever give away my heart again 

Love you, love this town; 
Love this mother-lovin' truck that keeps breakin' lovin' down 
There's only one four-letter word that'll do: 
Love you 

Love your cat; love this house 
Well, I can't believe myself that I'm lovin' gettin' out 
Love talkin'; love fightin'; 
Thought of never seein' your lovin' face 
There's some words that some words just have to replace 

Love you; love this town; 
Yeah, I'm sick an' lovin' tired of all your lovin' around 
There's only one four-letter word that'll do: 
Love you 

Love you; love this town; 
Yeah, I'm sick an' lovin' tired of all your lovin' around 
There's only one four-letter word that'll do: 
Love you 

Love you; love this town; 
Love this mother-lovin' truck that keeps breakin' lovin' down 
There's only one four-letter word that'll do: 
Love you 
Love you 
Love you 
Love you, honey
