You shatter me
Your grip on me
A hold on me so, dull it kills
You stifle me
Infectious sense of hopelessness
And prayers for rain
I suffocate
I breathe in dirt
And nowhere shines but desolate and drab
The hours all spent on killing time again
All waiting for the rain

You fracture me
Your hands on me
A touch so plain, so stale it kills
You strangle me
Entangle me in hopelessness
And prayers for rain
I deteriorate
I live in dirt
And nowhere glows but drearily and tired
The hours all spent on killing time again
All waiting for the rain

You fracture me
Your hands on me
A touch so plain, so stale it kills
You strangle me
Entangle me in hopelessness
And prayers for rain

Prayers for rain
Prayers for rain
Prayers for rain
