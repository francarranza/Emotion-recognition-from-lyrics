On my word of honor
All my love belongs to you
You put your faith in me
You'll see how true I'll be

On my word of honor
You can trust me with your heart
And I pledge mine to you
It's your's my whole life through

Let these lips never kiss you
Again if they're telling you a lie
If forever and ever and ever and ever and ever
Cross my heart and hope to die

On my word of honor
You mean everything to me
I sware by stars above
I'll keep my word my love

Let these lips never kiss you
Again if they're telling you a lie
If forever and ever and ever and ever and ever
Cross my heart and hope to die

On my word of honor
You mean everything to me
I sware by stars above
I'll keep my word my love

My loooooove
