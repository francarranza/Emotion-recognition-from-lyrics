Inanna, I emplore you
On the banks of the Euphrates
I am under your spell
Donna Sumeria

You have many to beg for (?) you
You descend into Hell
Now it's time so please return to me
Donna Sumeria

Ooh, I want love from you
From you I want love
Now it's all done
All done
Now it is all done

Ooh, I need love from you
From you I need love
Now it's all done
All done
Now it is all done

Ooh, I love love from you
From you I love love
Now it's all done
All done
Now it is all done
