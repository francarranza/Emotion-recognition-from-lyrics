You're wondering if I care about you
Is there some cause that I should doubt you
Oh, I can see, boy, that you don't know me very well
You're so unsure

And you run here and there to ask my feelings
Friends only guess, they can't say really
Don't ask my neighbors
Don't ask the friends I hang around
(Never ask the friends I hang around)
Don't be afraid to come to me (come to me)
Don't ask my neighbors, come to me (come to me)
Don't be afraid of what you'll see (what you'll see)
You'll find I love you (I love you)
Come to me (come to me), don't be afraid

You ask all my friends if I'm the same, boy
You don't understand, you think I'm changing
Don't ask my neighbors (don't ask my neighbor)
Don't ask the friends I hang around
(Never ask the friends I hang around)
No, don't be afraid (never) to come to me (come on)
Don't ask my neighbors, come to me (come on, come on)
Don't be afraid of what you'll see
(I'll make you feel at ease, baby)
You'll find I love you, come to me (come on)
Don't be afraid

Oh, baby
Don't ask my neighbors, come to me (come on)
Don't be afraid of what you'll see
You'll find I love you, come to me (baby)
Don't be afraid

Hurry, come to me
Come to me, come to me

Don't ask my neighbors, (I'll be real) come to me
Don't be afraid of what you'll see
You'll find I love you
Come to me, don't be afraid
(I'll be waiting, baby)
