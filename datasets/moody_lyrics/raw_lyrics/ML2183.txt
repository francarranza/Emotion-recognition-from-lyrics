(Feat. Melanie Pain)

(P.I.L)

This is not a love song

Happy to have
Not to have not
Big business is
Very wise
I'm crossing over into
Enter prize

This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song

I'm adaptable
And I like my new role
I'm getting better and better
I have a new goal
I'm changing my ways
Where money applies
This is not a love song

This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song

I'm going over to the over side
I'm happy to have
Not to have not
Big business is
Very wise
I'm inside free
Enterprise

This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song

Not television
Behind the curtain
Out of the cupboard
You take the first train
Into the big world
Are you ready to grab the candle
Not television

This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
