Hasta la vista, baby

You gave me love, you did me wrong
Didn't know what to do
But baby, I'm strong, gonna get over you
A new boy I'm gonna choose, you'll see

My love was true, still you threw it all away
Now other guys will have me, they'll appreciate my love
Tell me, how does it feel

You know that I needed you
You know that you meant the world to me
You know I had to have you
Now I'm gonna find somebody new

I'm looking for a new love, baby
A new love, yeah yeah yeah
I'm looking for a new love, baby
A new love, yeah yeah yeah

Was she hot, did she turn you out?
Curiosity rules my brain
Was she worth my heart? It's torn all apart
Are you going back again? Tell me

My love was true, still you threw it all away
But now you're like the rest, unworthy of my best
Hasta la vista, baby

You know that I needed you
You know that you meant the world to me
You know I had to have you
Now I'm gonna find somebody new
