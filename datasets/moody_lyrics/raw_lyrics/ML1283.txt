There's some things I forget
And if it's wrong, I keep it in check
'Cause what could I do
If we go out tonight
With that blood on your shirt?
Would it taste like a brand new shirt?
'Cause I don't know

Can you teach me how to fight?
Show me what it's like to give that pain
Show me how to fight, throw him down

There were times in the past
If I had the move, I couldn't make it last
Girl, it's wasted in the night
And is it really so hard?
Tell your body to forget the words
Pushing you too hard
'Cause I don't know

Can you teach me how to fight?
Show me what it's like to give that pain
Show me how to fight, throw him down
