Start off sometimes, now it's our time
Are you with me, are you with me?
Strange teenager, waiting for death at 19
Are you with me, are you with me?

I'm with you and there's nothing left to do
Tell me it's true
I'm with you and the stars are crashing through
Tell me it's true, I want everything with you

Never someone, says you're no one
Are you with me, are you with me?
Strange teenager, you'll never know death at 19
Are you with me, are you with me?

I'm with you and there's nothing left to do
Tell me it's true
I'm with you and the stars are crashing through
Tell me it's true, I want everything with you
