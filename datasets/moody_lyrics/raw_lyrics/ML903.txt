My boy Lollipop
You made my heart go giddy-up
You are as sweet as candy
You're my sugar dandy
Well oh, my boy Lollipop
Never ever leave me
Because it would grieve me
My heart told me so

I love you, I love you, I love you so
But I don't want you to know
I need you, I need you, I need you so
And I'll never let you go

My boy Lollipop
You make my heart go giddy-up
You set the world on fire
You are my one desire
Oh, my Lollipop

I love you, I love you, I love you so
But I don't want you to know
I need you, I need you, I need you so
And I'll never let you go

My boy Lollipop
You make my heart go giddy-up
You set the world on fire
You are my one desire

Oh, my Lollipop
Oh, my Lollipop
My boy Lollipop
My boy Lollipop
