Talking about stealing the show
No one would know
Talking about stealing the show
When they're all letting go
Take a look at the witch
See the twitch in her eye
Tell me what did she feel
Is this the weight of the world
Take a boy and a girl
And show them lying is real

And then I see the edge, I look I fall
And I get deeper and deeper
The more I see the more I fall
No place to hide, you better take the call
I get deeper and deeper

Is it the smell of the oil
Or the sweat and the toil
That makes living unreal
Was it the man in the suit
Or the one with a flute
Tell me, what did he steal
Is it beginning to break?
Can you see the mistake?
They'll be nowhere to go
Was it a fool's blood
In the wrong neighborhood
What price does he pay

And then I see the edge, I look I fall
I get deeper and deeper
The more I see the more I fall
No place to hide, you better take the call
I get deeper and deeper

To make you see what I mean
Tell me, what do I say
Hire your voice for freedom of choice
What do you say
So I'm talking about stealing the show
No one would know
Oh, I'm talking about stealing the show
When they're all letting go

And then I see the edge, I look I fall
And I get deeper and deeper
The more I see the more I fall
No place to hide, you better take the call
I get deeper and deeper

And then I see the edge, I look I fall
And I get deeper and deeper
The more I see the more I fall
No place to hide, you better take the call
I get deeper and deeper

Oh, oh, I see the edge, I look I fall
(The further I fall, the further I see)
No place to hide, you better take the call
(The further I fall)
I see the edge, I look I fall
(The further I fall, the further I see)
No place to hide, you better take the call

(The further I fall)
I see the edge, I look I fall
(The further I fall, the further I see)
No place to hide, you better take the call
(The further I fall)
I see the edge, I look I fall
(The further I fall, the further I see)
No place to hide, you better take the call
