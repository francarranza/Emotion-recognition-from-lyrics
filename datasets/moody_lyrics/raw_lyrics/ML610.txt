Song: One More Chance
Artist: Michael Jackson

Uh huh, all right
This time I'm gonna do my best to make it right
Can't go on without you by my side
Hold on
Shelter come and rescue me out of this storm
And out of this cold I need someone
Oh why oh why why why
If you see her
Tell her this from me
All I need is

One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more
One more chance at love
One more
See
Chance at love
One more
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more
One more chance at love
All right
One more chance at love

Searching for that one who is gonna make me whole
Help me make these mysteries unfold
Hold on
Lightning about to strike in rain only on me
Hurt so bad sometime it's hard to breathe
Oh why why
If you see her
Tell her this from me
All I need is

One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance for love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more
One more chance at love
One more chance at love

And I would walk around this world to find her
And I don't care what it takes no
Why
I'd sail the seven seas to be near her
And if you happen to see her
See, tell her this from me

One more chance at love
Yeah yeah
One more chance at love
Tell her this from me
One more chance at love
Yeah yeah
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
Lovin' you
One more chance at love
I can't find
One more chance at love
Lovin' you
One more chance at love
Yeah yeah one more
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
For love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
Yeah yeah I can't stop
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
Lovin' you
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
I can't stop
One more chance at love
Lovin' you
Aaow!
One more chance at love
I can't stop
Lovin' you...
