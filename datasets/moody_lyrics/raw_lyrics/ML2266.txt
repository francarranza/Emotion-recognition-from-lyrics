You're like the warm sunshine
I think of you all the time
I've fallen for you and that's a fact
What do you say to that

You're always in my dreams
I think you know what they mean
My heart knows this is real at last
What do you say to that

Life could never be the same without you
Love was never really love without you
Here beside you is really where it's at
What do you say to that

I promise I'll never leave
I'll always want you with me
Loving you won't ever be old hat
What do you say to that

Life could never be the same without you
Love was never really love without you
Here beside you is really where it's at
What do you say to that
What do you say

You're like the warm sunshine
I think of you all the time
I've fallen for you and that's a fact
What do you say to that
My heart knows this is real at last
What do you say that
