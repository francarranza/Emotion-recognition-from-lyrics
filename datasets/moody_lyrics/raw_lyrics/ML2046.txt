Darlin' you send me
Darlin' you send me
Darlin' you, send me boy
Honest you do

Darlin' you thrill me, boy
Darlin' you thrill me baby
Darlin' you thrill me
Honest you do

At first I thought it was infatuation
But it lasted so long
I found myself wanting to, to marry you
And carry you home

Honest you do, you do
Lord have mercy
I ain't lyin'
Honest you do
My Lord you do
My Lord you do...
Honest, really... Lord
You gotta believe me
You do, you do
Honest you do!
