The One
Tyrese
Let me start by sayin' that you're the one
'Cause this is the first time I felt like this plain as day (oh)
You're the only number that I dial (from other chicks)
You're the only sex I'm gettin' now (ain't that a trip)
But it don't matter (cause' you're in it)
And it don't matter (but then I get it)
'Cause you're the only one

(1)
Imma be good with just one girl
One girl
That's all I need
Imma be straight with just one crib And two whips
'Cause I'm grown and that's all that I need
Is the one ghetto girl that makes my baby squeeze
One ghetto girl I'm shakin' all of my chicks
That's why I'm down on one knee with one ring
Baby all I need is one

Ain't nothing gonna stop me from lovin' you
And wifing you
Spendin' all my life with you
Baby
I'm so committed
This one is one I'm with it
It's so damn good
All the sex you want without no hat (imagine that)
Got a real nigga that's gon' have your back (imagine that)
That's just the way it is
And that's just how it's gon' go
And you gon' be that one

(1-repeat)

Girl I ain't gonna front about it down and tell the truth about it (way gone)
Way gone
Ain't nothin' I won't give up just to make you that one
Baby that one girl

One step
One breath
One love
One name
So it's one me
One ring
One church
And one preacher
One choir
Two little words

(1-repeat)

Just one
One girl
One girl
Baby all I need is one (all I need is one)
One girl (one)
One girl (baby your the one)
Baby all I need is one
One me
One ring
One church
