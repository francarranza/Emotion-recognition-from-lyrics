Ooh mama mama mama,
Why you don't like my man
Ooh mama mama mama,
Why can't you understand

You say he's rough around the edges
He don't always act right
But when we're all alone
Don't you know he treats me right

Now loving him could be so easy
Loving him could be so easy
But mama don't like my man
No she don't like my man

Don't like the way he dresses
Or the cigarettes he smokes
Don't like the company he keeps
Or the color of his jokes
You say he ain't no good
He says he's rough and he is lazy
How can I explain
The way he drives me crazy

Loving him could be so easy
Loving him could be so easy
But mama don't like my man
No she don't like my man

Ooh mama mama mama,
Why you don't like my man
Ooh mama mama mama,
Why can't you understand

Loving him could be so easy
Loving him could be so easy
But mama don't like my man
No she don't like my man
