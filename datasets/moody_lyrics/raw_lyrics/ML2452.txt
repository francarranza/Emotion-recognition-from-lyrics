I meant to come back to put out bliss
But the style's crumbling, covered, canned
It was sick and no, you don't even know how it comes and shifts
Then gets ruined by you fucking slobs

It's classical
Anyway

I can't help it, it makes me so sick over and over
It sits stiff, bound with no heart
Fine 'cause this is where the separation starts arising
I can see it coming over your cloud

It's classical
Anyway
How cool are you?
I remember

I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick

It's just a bad call, it's so funny
How you think I'm so serious, but that's not it
The thing is, I don't give enough to give a fuck
You're just plain boring and you bore me asleep

It's classical
Anyway
How cool are you?
I remember

I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick

Feel sickened
Feel sickened
Feel sickened
Feel sickened
Feel sickened
Feel sickened
Feel sickened
I feel sick

And who the fuck are you anyway, you fuck?
It's making sick sense seeing how you're sticking out
Hardly hoping, money, please arise up off the fucking knees
Hop off the train for a second and try to find your own fucking heart

It's classical
Anyway
How cool are you?
I remember

I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick

Feel sickened
Feel sickened
Feel sickened
Feel sickened
Feel sickened
Feel sickened
Feel sickened
Feel sickened

I feel sick in my head
I feel sick in my head
I feel sick in my head
I feel sick in my head
I feel sick in my head
I feel sick in my head
I feel sick in my head
I feel sick
