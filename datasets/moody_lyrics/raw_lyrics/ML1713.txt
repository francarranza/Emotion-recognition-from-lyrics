I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself what a wonderful world

I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, saying how do you do
They're only saying I love you

I see babies crying, I watch them grow
They'll learn so much more than I'll ever know
Then I think to myself what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, saying how do you do
They're only saying I love you

I see babies crying, I watch them grow
They'll learn so much more than I'll ever know
Then I think to myself what a wonderful world
Then I think to myself what a wonderful world
