White demon love song down the hall
White demon shadow on the road
Back up your mind, there is a call
He isn't coming after all

Love this time
She likes the way he sings
White demon love song's in her dreams

White demon, where's your selfish kiss?
White demon sorrow will arrange
Let's not forget about the fear
Black invitation to a place that cannot change

While strangely holy
Come for a rain


White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friend go?
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friends go?

Let us be in love 
Let's do old and gray 
I won't make you cry 
I will never stray 
I will do my part 
Let us be in love tonight

White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friend go?
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friend go?
