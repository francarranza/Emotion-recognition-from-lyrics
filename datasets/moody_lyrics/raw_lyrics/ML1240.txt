Some people say
You've got to fight for a love that's true.
Climb every mountain,
See every trial and tribulation through.
I'm here to tell you
That's only half the lesson.
Now if you want a girl to come to you,
You've got to leave a little room for guessin'.

Oh, just be easy baby,
That girl will come running to you.
If you just be easy, baby,
She'll be easy, too.

Don't you know it's just a fool who plays the part,
Running a girl down like she's a game in a school yard?
Now if she waits, you should turn and let her alone
And she'll come to you just as sure as you're born.

Be easy, baby.
That girl will come running to you.
If you just be easy, baby,
She'll be easy, too.

Don't you know
A woman don't want a man down on his knees,
Running her down like a mouse at the cheese?
You've got to be mettle if you want her affection.
Get too excited, and she's off in another direction.

So be easy, baby.
That girl will come running to you.
If you just be easy, baby,
She'll be easy, too.
