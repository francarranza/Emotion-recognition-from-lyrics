It is your character
Deep in your nature
Take one example
Sample and hold
Romance and replace
The lack in yourself
It's your nature
It's your nature
We see you climbing
Improving the effort
Wearing my suit
It is your character
There is a limit
Over your shoulder
Everyone loves you
Until they know you
Perfume aerosols
May champion the strangers
Nick
Standing around
All the right people
Crawling
Tennis on Tuesday
The ladder is long
It is your nature
You've gotta suntan
Football on Sunday
Society boy
On Social Security
It is your nature
Tennis on Tuesday
Sipping champagne
Football on Sunday
Home on the train
It is your nature
Girl from Totteridge Park
Said you were nice
So was my suit
The ladder is long
