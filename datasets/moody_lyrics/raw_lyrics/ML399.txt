If you were in my heart I'd surely not break you
If you were beside me then my love would take you
I'd keep you in safety forever protect you
I'll hide you away from the world you rejected
I'll hide you

Take my hand
Show you feel
Look in my eyes
It's perfectly clear
I love you and cover you
Ask me to tell you what I wanna do
I'll hide you
Away from danger

If you were in my heart I'd surely not break you
If you were beside me then my love would take you
I'd keep you in safety forever protect you
I'll hide you away from the world you rejected
I'll hide you

Take my hand
Show you feel
Look in my eyes
It's perfectly clear
I love you and cover you
Ask me to tell you what I wanna do
I'll hide you
Away from danger

If you were in my heart I'd surely not break you
If you were beside me then my love would take you
I'd keep you in safety forever protect you
I'll hide you away from the world you rejected
I'll hide you
