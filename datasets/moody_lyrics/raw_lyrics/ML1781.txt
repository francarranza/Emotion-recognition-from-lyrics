People get ready
It's time to show what you got
Players take your places
There's only one way to the top

You must feel the victory
Release that energy
And ride like the wind
With fire in your eyes
Shake those butterflies
And do the best you can

Victory (sweet) victory
Let the party begin
Victory (sweet) victory
Let's do it again

You are the best
You seem to stand out from the rest
Ooh, your intentions
To be more than a honorable mention

You must feel the victory
Release that energy
And ride like the wind
With fire in your eyes
Shake those butterflies
Go ahead
And go for the win now

Victory, victory
Let the party begin
Victory, victory
Everybody can win

'Cause it's the same way in life
(Same way in life)
Inside the tunnel see the light
(See the light)
The perfect balance and you must
Find it's the same way in life
Victory, victory, victory

Victory (sweet, ooh)
Victory (sweet)
Victory (sweet, ooh)
Can you feel it?
Victory (sweet)
So sweet, so sweet

There's only one way to the top
If you really want it
You can never stop pushin'
For the victory go ahead
Players take your places
Go ahead
Feel that victory
Release that energy
So sweet to the top
Go ahead, go ahead

Players take your places to the top
