If I gave you pretty enough words
Could you paint a picture of us that works?
An emphasis on function rather than design
Aren't you tired? 'Cause I will carry you
On a broken back and blown out knees
I have been where you are for a while

Aren't you tired of being weak?
Such rage that you could scream
All the stars right out of the sky
And destroy the prettiest starry night
Every evening that I die

I am exhumed
Just a little less human
And a lot more bitter and cold

I am exhumed
Just a little less human
And a lot more bitter and cold

I am exhumed
Just a little less human
And a lot more bitter and cold

I am exhumed
Just a little less human

After all these images of pain
Have cut right through you
I will kiss every scar
And weep you are not alone
Then I'll show you that place
In my chest where my heart
Still tries to beat, it still tries to beat

Aren't you tired of being weak?
Such rage that you could scream
All stars right out of the sky
And destroy the prettiest starry night
Every evening that I die

Live. Love. Burn. Die.
Live. Love. Burn. Die.
Live. Love. Burn. Die.
Live. Love. Burn. Die.
