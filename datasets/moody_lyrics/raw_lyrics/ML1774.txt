What is this feeling called love? 
What is this crazy scene I can't work out no how? 
What is this feeling called love? 
What is this crazy scene I can't understand no how?

Maybe I should try it now 
Or maybe I should be shy of it now, now, now, now, now
'Cause there's nothing you know that can explain it 
And there's nothing you know that's worth the pain of it 

What is this feeling called love? 
What is this crazy scene I can't work out no how? 
What is this feeling called love? 
What is this crazy scene I can't understand no how?

Gimme love 
Gimme love 
Gimme love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
