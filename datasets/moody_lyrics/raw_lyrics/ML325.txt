I walked home alone today
Quickly I was lost along the way
Till You stepped out in front of me
You took my hands and said come on and follow me
This is love

That You shine on
The darkness all around us
It all just disappears
You shine on
The walls that crash around us
Whenever You are near
Whoa
Whoa

You and me we used to be
Lovers torn and lost along the way
Until Heaven came and rescued me
I found grace right in front of me
This is love

That You shine on
The darkness all around us
It all just disappears
You shine on
The walls that crash around us
Whenever You are near

We'll never be the same
'Cause You never look away
We'll never be the same
'Cause You never look away

That You shine on
The darkness all around
Yeah You shine on
The walls that crash around us
Whenever You are near

'Cause You shine on
The darkness all around us
It all just disappears
And You shine on
The walls that crash around us
Whenever You are near

You never look away
You never look away
