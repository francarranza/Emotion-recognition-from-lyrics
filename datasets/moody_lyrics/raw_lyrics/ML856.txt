But a woman like you, baby, should never have the blues

You're always a part of my dream
Holding me tight and telling me everything
I wanna hear

Don't forget me baby, all you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about you, if I can do anything at all
Let me help
If your child needs a daddy, I can help

It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help
