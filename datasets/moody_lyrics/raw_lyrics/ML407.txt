Touch me, turn me on and burn me down 

Your lips hold a wild desire
And give a kiss like the devil's fire
Your kind of love could burn a town
Oh, touch me, turn me on and burn me down

Your touch brings me to my knees
You've got me begging please, please, please
Take my heart and melt it down
Touch me, turn me on and burn me down

You're a wild love I can't tame
Your kisses burn like flames
I go crazy when you're around
So touch me, turn me on and burn me down

I'm devoured by your fiery flame
My lips can only speak your name
Just spread my ashes all around
Oh, touch me, turn me on and burn me down

You're a wild love I can't tame
Your kisses burn like flames
I go crazy when you're around
So touch me, turn me on and burn me down
Touch me, turn me on and burn me down
