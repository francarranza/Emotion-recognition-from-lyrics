So you think your schooling's phoney
I guess it's hard not to agree
You say it all depends on the money
And who is in your family tree

Right (Right), you're bloody well right
You got a bloody right to say
Right, you're bloody well right
You know you got a right to say

Ha-ha, you're bloody well right
You know you're right to say
Yeah-yeah, you're bloody well right
You know you're right to say
Me, I don't care anyway

Write your problems down in detail
Take them to a higher place
You've had your cry, no, I should say wail
In the meantime, hush your face

Right (Quite right), you're bloody well right
You got a bloody right to say
Right, you're bloody well right
You know you got a right to say

Ha-ha, you're bloody well right
You know you're right to say
Yeah-yeah, you're bloody well right
You know you got a right to say
You got a bloody right to say
You got a bloody right to say
You got a bloody right to say
You got a bloody right to say
