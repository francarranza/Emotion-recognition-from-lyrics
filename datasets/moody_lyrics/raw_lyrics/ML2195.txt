When you said yesterday that it's nearly Christmas
What did I want and I thought just love me, love me, love me
That's what I want for Christmas

When I walk through a room let them see you need me
Walk through a room let them see you love me, love me, love me
That's what I want for Christmas

Anyone can wish for all the trinkets in the window
Some can even buy the things they see
But the presents that I want (I want)
You'll never find in any window
Bring me love and bring it just for me (for me)

When you come home at night (baby)
Take me in your arms and hold me (baby)
Kiss me, and (let them say you love me) say you love me, love me, oh love me
That's what I want for Christmas

Da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da

Love me, Love me
Oh That's what I want, that's what I want for Christmas

Anyone can wish for all the trinkets in the window
Some can even buy the things they see (that's what I want, that's what I want)
But the presents that I want (I want)
You'll never find in any window
Bring me love and bring it just for me (for me)

When you come home at night
And you take me in your arms
And you hold me (hold me) kiss me (kiss me, let them see you love me)
And say you love me (love me), love me (love me), love me (love me, love me)
That's what I want for Christmas (that's what I want, that's what I want)

(Hold me) Hold me
(Kiss me) Kiss me
That's what I want for Christmas
