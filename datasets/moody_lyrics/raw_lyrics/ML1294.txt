Waiting in the club lounge
I slot in so systematically
I wanna smash it to pieces
Release this hatred inside of me

You know you fill me with passion
But I just act apologetically
I'm gonna miss you in fashion
All ashen faced with my deceit

São Paulo
Why am I bringing me down?
São Paulo
If I drink any more I will drown
São Paulo
Why can't I fight truth decay?
São Paulo
My life is just one big cliche

Another stain on my passport
I wanna travel so futuristically
I just wish I could beam up, team up
And soon be on my way

You told me we'd go to Rio
And you said it so charismatically
I know it's me that's the nightmare
So fight fair or have some decency

São Paulo
Why am I bringing me down?
São Paulo
If I drink any more I will drown
São Paulo
Why can't I fight truth decay?
São Paulo
My life is just one big cliche

São Paulo
Why am I bringing me down
São Paulo
If I drink any more I will drown
São Paulo
Why can't I fight truth decay?
São Paulo
My life is just one big cliche

You sure put a spin on my day
Why am I heading your way
Everything is coming up grey
I'm just a humble DJ
