The funky monkeys is coming
The funky monkeys is coming

Oh dear oh dear my friends
Seems like a fight they didn't get
Fear more my friends
Oh dear oh dear my friends
Seems like a fight they want again
Fear more my friends

The funky monkeys is coming
The funky monkeys is coming
The funky monkeys is coming

Oh dear oh dear my friends
Seems like a fight they didn't get
Fear more my friends
Oh dear oh dear my friends
Seems like a fight they want again
Well it's us or them

This is a new rock coming to town
Coming to eat all you motherfuckers
Catch all our vapour you bitches

Oh dear oh dear my friends
Seems like a fight they didn't get
Fear more my friends
Oh dear oh dear my friends
Seems like a fight they want again
Well it's us or them

You hoe ass bitches
There's a new rock coming to town
And it coming to eat all you motherfuckers
And it's not for sale
You better catch our vapours
Eat our shit and suck on this
