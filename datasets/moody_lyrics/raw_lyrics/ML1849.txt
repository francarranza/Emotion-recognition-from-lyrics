Go if you want to
I never tried to stop you
Know there's a reason
For all of this you're feeling
Low, it's not my call
You couldn't ever love me more

You couldn't love me more
You couldn't love

Me, I don't show much
It's not that hard to hide you
See in a moment
I can't remember how to
Be all you wanted
I couldn't ever love you more

I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love

You want me to cry and play my part
I want you to sigh and fall apart
We want this like everyone else

Stay if you want to
I always wait to hear you
Say there's a last kiss
For all the times you run this
Way, it's not my fault
You couldn't ever love me more

You couldn't love me more
You couldn't love me more
Love me more

I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love

You want me to lie not break your heart
I want you to fly not stop and start
We want us like everything else

Maybe we didn't understand
It's just the end of the world
Maybe we didn't understand
Not just a boy and a girl
It's just the end of the, end of the world

Me, I don't say much
It's far too hard to make you
See in a moment
I still forget just how to
Be all you wanted
I couldn't ever love you more

I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love you more
