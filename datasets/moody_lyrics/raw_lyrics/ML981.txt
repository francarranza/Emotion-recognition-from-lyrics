Can you hear them
The helicopters
I'm in New York
No need for words now
We sit in silence
You look me
In the eye directly
You met me
I think it's Wednesday
The evening
The mess we're in and

(Oh) The city sun set over me
(Oh) The city sun set over me

Night and day
I dream of making love
To you now, baby
Love-making
On screen
Impossible dream
And I have seen
The sunrise
Over the river
The freeway
Reminding of
This mess we're in and

(Oh) The city sun set over me
(Oh) The city sun set over me

(Oh) The city sun set over me
(Oh) The city sun set over me

What were you wanting (what was it you wanted)
I just want to say (I just want to say)
(Don't ever change) Don't ever change now, baby 
(And thank you) And thank you
(I don't think we will meet again) I don't think we will meet again
(And you must leave now) And you must leave now
(Before the sun rises over the skyscrapers) Before the sunrise
(And the city landscape comes into view) Above skyscrapers
(Sweat on my skin, oh) The sin and
This mess we're in and

(Oh) The city sun set over me
(Oh) The city sun set over me
(Oh) The city sun set over me
(Oh) The city sun set over me
