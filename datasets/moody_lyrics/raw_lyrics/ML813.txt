You wonder why I'm always screaming
You wonder why I talk so loud
You want me in your inner circle
You're turning me inside out
You turned me inside out
You wonder why I'm always shouting
You wonder why I've gotta yell
You ask me why I don't hang out
Cause you turned this into a livin' hell
You look at me like I'm off my rocker
And why I wear this godamn frown
Now it's time to screw your ego
Cause you turned mine upside down
Upside down
