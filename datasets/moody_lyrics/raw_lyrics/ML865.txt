Uh how long
How long have you been away?
Oh how long, can't find no words to say

I've kept your picture on my shelf (thinkin' 'bout you babe)
Only there to remind myself (thinkin' 'bout you babe)
I have always care for you, do you still love me?

Oh my flame (my flame)
Somethings will never change
Still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me (say that you love me, say that you love me)

Oh my flame (my flame)
Somethings will never change
Still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me (say that you love me)
Say you still love me (my flame)

Uh my love
Will I ever make you see
Oh that somehow, you are still apart of me
Maybe we can compromise
'Cause our love just can't be disguised
I have always care for you, do you still love me?

Oh my flame (my flame)
Somethings will never change


Still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me (say that you love me, say that you love me)

Oh my flame (my flame)
Somethings will never change
Still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me (say that you love me)
Say you still love me (my flame, oh)

I've kept your picture on my shelf
Only there to remind myself (thinkin' 'bout you babe)
I have always care for you, do you still love me?

Oh my flame (my flame)
Somethings will never change (somethings will never change)
Still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me (say that you love me, say that you love me)

Oh my flame (my flame)
Somethings will never change
Still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me (say that you love me, say that you love me)
Say you still love me (my flame)
Say you still love me (say that you love me)
Say you still love me (my flame)
Say you still love me (say that you love me)
Say you still love me
