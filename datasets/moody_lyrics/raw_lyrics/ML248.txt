I love sleeping in on saturdays
And I love college football games
I love not acting my age
And a good barbeque

Yeah I'm a fan of faulkner books
And anything my mama cooks
Small mouth bass have got me hooked
On Sunday afternoon

Yes I love good cold beer
And mustard on my fries
I love a good loud honky tonk
That rocks on Friday night
And hell yes I love my truck
But I want you to know
Honey I love your love the most

Man I love how redman taste
And damn I love my nascar race
Any song sung by george strait
Is country at it's best

Yes I love good cold beer
And mustard on my fries
I love a good loud honky tonk
That rocks on Friday night
And hell yes I love my truck
But I want you to know
Honey I love your love the most

I love

Yeah I love scuffed up cowboy boots
And broken tore up jeans
A four wheel drive eight point bucks
And rocky road ice cream
And hell yes I love my dog
And jack d in my coke
But honey I love your love

Yeah I love your love the most
