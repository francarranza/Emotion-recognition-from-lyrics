I don't mind to give you a slow dance or two
I'm sorry I'm not at my best
I know you can see I'm incredibly blue
But I'm not that lonely yet

I look in your eyes while you're dancing with me
And try to fulfill your request
But don't ask for favors when it's time to leave
'Cause I'm not that lonely yet

Now don't say you want me
I've heard that before
The words weigh like stones in my head
There may come a time when I'll think of you more
But I'm not that lonely yet

It's nice to be dancing
To waltzes again
And maybe it helps to forget
You've opened the door but I'm not waltzing in
'Cause I'm not that lonely yet
No I'm not that lonely yet
