I'm so sick of you, so sick of me
I don't want to be with you
I'm so sick of you, so sick of me
I don't want to be with you

I want to fly away
I want to fly away

I'm so sick of work, so sick of play
I don't need another day
I'm so sick of work, so sick of play
I don't need another day

I need a hideaway
I need a hideaway, yeah
Oh

Hey, hey, hey
Oh

Every shiny toy that at first brings you joy
Will always start to cloy and annoy
Every camera, every phone, all the music that you own
Won't change the fact you're all alone (All alone)
Every piece of land, every city that you plan
Will crumble into tiny grains of sand
Everything you find that at first seems to shine
Always turns into the same old grind (Same old grind)

I want to fly away
I want to fly away

I'm so sick of you, so sick of me
I don't want to be with you
I'm so sick of you, so sick of me
I don't want to be with you

Every little dance, every Internet romance
All alone (All alone)
All alone
I'm so sick of you, so sick of me (Everything you find that at first seems to shine)
I don't want to be with you (Always turns into the same old grind)
