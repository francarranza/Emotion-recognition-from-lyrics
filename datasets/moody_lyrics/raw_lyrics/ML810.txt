Oh, watchin' the people get lairy
It's not very pretty, I tell thee
Walkin' through town is quite scary
And not very sensible either
A friend of a friend he got beaten
He looked the wrong way at a policeman
Would never have happened to Smeaton
An old Leodiensian

I predict a riot, I predict a riot
I predict a riot, I predict a riot

Oh, I try to get to my taxi
A man in a tracksuit attacks me
He said that he saw it before me
Wants to get things a bit gory
Girls scrabble round with no clothes on
To borrow a pound for a condom
If it wasn't for chip fat, they'd be frozen
They're not very sensible

I predict a riot, I predict a riot
I predict a riot, I predict a riot

And if there's anybody left in here
That doesn't want to be out there

Ow!

Oh, watchin' the people get lairy
It's not very pretty, I tell thee
Walkin' through town is quite scary
Not very sensible

I predict a riot, I predict a riot
I predict a riot, I predict a riot

And if there's anybody left in here
That doesn't want to be out there

I predict a riot, I predict a riot
I predict a riot, I predict a riot
