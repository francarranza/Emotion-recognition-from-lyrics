Crawling
Over your window, you think I'm confused
I'm waiting for the divergent wasp
To complete my current ruse

You use a plate-glass screen
To protect my chosen target
But there's an air-pellet hole
I can crawl through to you

I am the fly in the ointment
I can spread more disease than the fleas
Which nibble away at your window display

Yes, I am the fly in the ointment
I shake you down to say please
As you accept the next dose of disease

I am the fly, I am the fly
I am the fly, I am the fly
Fly in the, fly in the ointment
I am the fly, I am the fly
I am the fly, I am the fly
Fly in the, fly in the ointment

I am the fly, I am the fly
I am the fly, I am the fly
Fly in the, fly in the ointment
Yes, I am the fly, I am the fly
I am the fly, I am the fly
Fly in the, fly in the ointment
I am the fly, I am the fly
I am the fly, I am the fly
Fly in the, fly in the ointment
Yes, I am the fly, I am the fly
I am the fly, I am the fly
Fly in the, fly in the ointment

I am the fly
