A little girl upon the fireplace
Only air flying emotionless
Ring the bells for she could keep flying
This is me, completely me

End of day, we watched the sun go down
But I can see, you're like a firework
You wanna save me, people will save me
But this is you, completely you

Now it's day but I am dreaming
A man walks by, I want to be his wife
I'm only here sometimes
Under the tree of life
I'm only good sometimes
Taking my time to go home

Like a candle wasted from burning
I got shoes tired from walking
Calling out your name, my lips keep failing
They have now forgot to sing

Now it's day but I am dreaming
A man walks by, I want to be his wife
I'm only here sometimes
Under the tree of life
I'm only good sometimes
Taking my time to go home

I'm only here sometimes
Under the tree of life
I'm only good sometimes
Taking my time to go home

I'm only here sometimes
Under the tree of life
I'm only here sometimes
Taking my time to go home
