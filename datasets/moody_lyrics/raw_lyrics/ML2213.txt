Deathly manner in the army to fight
Holy flames that have once come alive
We embrace tonight
Acrid sword, sharp as my life

Divine

Light the beacon through the embers of time
I've been betrayed, but now cross my line
Reborn to thrive
Cut 'em down, storming the hive

Divine

Fire Spitter
Fire Spitter

Power of the old ways shrined
Arise the spirit of the war god's kind
Fire baptized line
At your throat, accursed line

Fire Spitter
Fire Spitter

Deathly manner in the army to fight
Holy flames that have once come alive
We embrace tonight
