I left while you were sleeping
While Abraham shaped your sigh
Never loved you less, never loved you more
As when Sirius hung in the sky

A memory is a memory
And a dream is a liar
Was I a man dreaming I was a lamb
Or am I sleeping in clover tonight?

While men are dreaming

They know it not a dream
Upon wakin' we're fools again
What if we're sleeping?

A memory is a memory
And a dream is a liar
Was I a woman to never see you again?
Or am I dreaming asleep by your side?
