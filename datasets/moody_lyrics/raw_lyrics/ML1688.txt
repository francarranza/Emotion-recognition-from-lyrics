It don't jingle like a jingle bell
It ain't made by a bunch of elves
It don't come from the old North Pole
Can't be delivered by a Ho-Ho-Ho

What it is
Your gonna love it
You can't get too much of it
Here's the package, baby, open it up
I'm giving you all my love for Christmas
I'm giving you all my love

You won't find it underneath the tree
You can't buy it with a roll of green
It's the thing that makes life worth living
It's the gift that just keeps on giving

What it is
Your gonna love it
You can't get too much of it
Here's the package, baby, open it up
I'm giving you all my love for Christmas
I'm giving you all my love

Yeah, what it is
Your gonna love it
You can't get too much of it
Here's the package, baby, open it up
I'm giving you all my love for Christmas
I'm giving you all my love for Christmas
I'm giving you all my love
