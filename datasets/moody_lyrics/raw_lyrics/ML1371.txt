Don't guess I've ever loved another
Never once before did I really see the light
'Cause they were barely friends and merely lovers
And it's taken what you've given me to feel like I do tonight

I am moved by the spirit
I'm here to testify
I found an amen kind of love
The kind that makes you fall down on your knees
And reach for the sky above
The kind that your soul just can't never get enough
I found an amen, an amen, an amen kind of love

You've given love a brand new meaning
Bound by a higher power than I've ever known before
Safe in your faithful arms I am leaning
Once I was lost but now I'm found forevermore

And I am moved by the spirit
I'm here to testify
I found an amen kind of love
The kind that makes you fall down on your knees
And reach for the sky above
The kind that your soul just can't never get enough
I found an amen, an amen, an amen kind of love

We are moved by the spirit
We are here to testify
We've found an amen kind of love
The kind that makes you fall down on your knees
And reach for the sky above
The kind that your soul just can't never get enough
We've found an amen, an amen, an amen kind of love
