It may not kill me but it's sure gonna hurt

Since my baby left me, I don't know what to do
Just couldn't believe my eyes when I saw him with you
He left me for you, oh, he's treating me like dirt
It may not kill me but it's sure gonna hurt

It's sure gonna hurt to lose you
My poor heart's in pain
Don't see how you could abuse me
It's driving me insane

Oh, you're both out paintin' the town red
Well, I'm paintin' it too but I'm not paintin' the town red
I'm paintin' it blue
It hurts to lose everything to such a little flirt
It may not kill me but it's sure gonna hurt

It's sure gonna hurt to lose you
My poor heart's in pain
Don't see how you could abuse me
It's driving me insane

Oh, you're both out paintin' the town red
Well, I'm paintin' it too but I'm not paintin' the town red
I'm paintin' it blue
It hurts to lose everything to such a little flirt
It may not kill me but it's sure gonna hurt

It's sure gonna hurt
It's sure gonna hurt to lose you
My poor heart's in pain
Don't see how you could abuse me
It's driving me insane
