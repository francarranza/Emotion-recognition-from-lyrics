Oh Matilda, it was I who took the pill
That killed you
Oh sweet Matilda, I took that pill
And washed it down the water

And I hit the town that very night

Oh sweet Matilda, I was not ready
Was not ready for you
Oh sweet, sweet Matilda, I took that pill
And washed it down with water

It smelt so sweet but it made me sick

Are you lonely now?
Now you've swallowed me down
