Woo, Yeah!

As poor as I am I've got my ambition
Keep my distance from war and contention
I might not be rich but I sure got style
Got some good friends,
But still some who hate me
Tell their lies
And still that don't quake me
The joy that's inside
Brings out my healthy smile

Try if you want
Can't stop me
Lie if you want
Still won't move me
Won't move me
No
Won't move me, at all.(x2)


I know who I am
I don't let nobody
Underestimate me and you'll end up sorry
The father will humble you like a child
Oh Yeah
I'm getting stronger
So much stronger
Day by day
I'm getting stronger
So much stronger
Can't move me
Can't move me
No

Try if you want
Can't stop me
Lie if you want
Still won't move me
Won't move me
No
Won't move me, at all.(x2)

Amidst all the pressures
I've still got to make it
Always pushing
The sky is my limit
So keep your idle talk
I don't have the time
There's so much in life
If you're willing to earn it
I'll give you some of mine
But please don't stress it
Awake from the slumber
Open up your eyes


Try if you want
Can't stop me
Lie if you want
Still won't move me
Won't move me
No
Won't move me, at all.(x2)


I'm getting stronger
So much stronger (stronger and stronger)
And you can't move me, no (can't move me, can't move me)


Poor as I am I've got my ambition
Keep my distance from war and contention
I might not be rich but I sure got style
Got some good friends,
But still some who hate me
Tell their lies
And still that don't quake me
The joy that's inside
Brings out my healthy smile


Try if you want
Can't stop me
Lie if you want
Still won't move me
Won't move me
No
Won't move me, at all.(x3)
