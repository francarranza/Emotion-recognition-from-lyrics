There's something in the air tonight
A feeling that you have that could change your life
There's something burning up inside
I reach out for you and our hearts collide

With hearts on fire I reach out to you tonight
With hearts on fire I reach out to you tonight
Hearts on fire I reach out to you tonight
With hearts on fire I reach out to you tonight

With hearts on fire I reach out to you tonight
With hearts on fire I reach out to you tonight
With hearts on fire I reach out to you tonight
With hearts on fire I reach out to you tonight

I've been searching for a love alive
Drowning in the silence as we walk the night
Your hand is out and brushes mine
A moment that is frozen as we hang in time

With hearts on fire I reach out to you tonight
With hearts on fire I reach out to you tonight
Hearts on fire I reach out to you tonight
With hearts on fire I reach out to you tonight

With hearts on fire I reach out to you tonight
With hearts on fire I reach out to you tonight
With hearts on fire I reach out to you tonight
With hearts on fire I reach out to you tonight
