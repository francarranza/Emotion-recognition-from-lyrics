Baby, I don't wanna a soul,
Hangin' around my house when I'm not home.
Oh, I don't want a soul, baby,
Hangin' around my house when I'm not home.
I don't want you to open the door for nobody, woman,
Oh, when you're home and you know you're all alone.

Your sister might wanna visit us,
But the little girl she talk too much.
If she just come by to visit us,
Tell her to meet us Sunday, Sunday, down at the church.
'Cause I don't want a soul, baby,
Hangin' around my house when I'm not at home.
Yes, I don't want you to open the door for nobody, baby,
Oh, when you're home and you know you're all alone.

Your mother might wanna visit us,
But you tell you mamma I get home 'bout the break a day.
And that's too late to visit anybody, baby,
So, tell you mamma to please, please, please stay away.
'Cause I don't want a soul, baby,
Hangin' around my house when I'm not at home.
Yes, I don't want you to open the door for anybody, woman,
Oh, when you're home and you know you're all alone.

You might feel a little sick, baby,
And you know you're home all alone,
I don't want the doctor at my house, baby,
You just suffer, suffer, suffer till I get home.
'Cause I don't want a soul, baby,
Hangin' around my house when I'm not at home.
Yes, I don't want you to open the door for nobody, woman,
Baby, when you're home and all alone.
Yeah!
