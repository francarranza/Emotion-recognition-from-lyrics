Just an old-fashioned love song 
Playin' on the radio
And wrapped around the music 
Is the sound of someone promising they'll never go
You swear you've heard it before
As it slowly rambles on
No need in bringing 'em back
'Cause they're never really gone

Just an old-fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me
Just an old-fashioned love song
Comin' down in three-part harmony

To weave our dreams upon and listen 
To each evening when the lights are low
To underscore our love affair with tenderness and feelings 
That we've come to know
You swear you've heard it before
As it slowly rambles on and on
No need in bringing 'em back
'Cause they're never really gone

Just an old-fashioned love song
Comin' down in three-part harmony
Just an old-fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me
Just an old-fashioned love song
Comin' down in three-part harmony
Just an old-fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me

To weave our dreams upon and listen to a song

Just an old song, comin' down
Just an old song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me
Just an old song, comin' down
Just an old song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me

Just an old-fashioned love song
Comin' down in three-part harmony
Just an old-fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me

Just an old-fashioned love song
Comin' down in three-part harmony
Just an old-fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me
