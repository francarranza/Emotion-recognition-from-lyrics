You make me come
You make me complete
You make me completely miserable

Stuck to a chair
Watching this story about me
Everything goes by so fast
Making my head spin
Used up all of my friends, but who needs them
When you mean everything

I love the things that we should fear
I'm not afraid of being here
So much the same
It makes me helpless alone

Nothing to share
Why should I care if you're near me?
Give up all of my plans, but who needs them
When you mean everything

I love the things that we should fear
I'm not afraid of being here
So much the same
It makes me helpless alone

You make me come
You make me complete
You make me completely miserable

I love the thing that we should fear
I'm not afraid of being here
So much the same it makes me helpless alone

You make me come
You make me complete
You make me completely miserable
