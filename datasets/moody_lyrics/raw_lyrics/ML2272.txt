If I stop
And think about it
I'm either stone cold certain
Or more inclined to doubt it
But when you jump into the darkness
Well I take off my hat

You've changed
They say you can know when to play or to hold
And they think they can show all that glitters is gold
And they don't care to go where you go
'Cause they know you're insane
When you change
To the uptown train

Well I knew
That you were trouble
You were a ten-time loser
Or maybe even double
But you pulled some kind of rabbit
From your hippie hat

You've changed
They say take it slow when you're breaking the mold
Got to pay what you owe or be out in the cold
And they don't care to know what you know
Or to go through the pain
To change
To the uptown train
