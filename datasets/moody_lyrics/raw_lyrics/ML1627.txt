Give me your eyes, I need sunshine
Give me your eyes, I need sunshine
Your blood, your bones, your voice, and your ghost

We've both been very brave
Walk around with both legs
Fight the scary day
We both pulled the tricks out of our sleeves, but
I'll believe in anything and you'll believe in anything
Said I'll believe in anything and you'll believe in anything

If I could get the fire out from the wire
I'd share a life and you'd share a life
If I could take the fire out from the wire
I'd share a life and you'd share a life
If I could take the fire out from the wire
I'd take you where nobody knows you and
Nobody gives a damn

I said nobody knows you and
Nobody gives a damn

And I could take another hit for you
And I could take away your trips from you
And I could take away the salt from your eyes
Take away what's been assaulting you
And I could give you my apologies
By handing over all the olive trees
And I could take away your shaky knees
And I could give you all the olive trees
And look at the trees and look at my face and look at a place far away from here

So give me your eyes, I need sunshine
Give me your eyes, I need sunshine
Your blood, your bones, your voice, and your ghost
We've both been very brave
Walk around with both legs
Fight the scary day
We both pulled the tricks right out of our sleeves
But I'll believe in anything and you'll believe in anything

If I could take the fire out from the wire
I'd share a life and you'd share a life
If I could take the fire out from the wire
I'd share a life and you'd share a life
If I could take the fire out from the wire
I'd take you where nobody knows you and
Nobody gives a damn
I said nobody knows you
And nobody gives a damn

I said nobody knows you
And nobody gives a damn either way
About your blood, your bones, your voice, and your ghost
Because nobody knows you
And nobody gives a damn either way
You know I'll believe in anything and you'll believe in anything
Because nobody knows you
And nobody gives a damn either way
