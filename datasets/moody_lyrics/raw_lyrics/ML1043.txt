Rockin' steady in her daddy's car
She got the stereo with the big guitars
And that's all right
Yeah 

I got the itch and a restless soul
She gone with the wind, gonna go for broke tonight, yeah
And that's 

Girl, we've been meant for this since we were born 
No problems now, the coast is clear 
It's just the calm before the storm

This must be just like livin' in paradise 
And I don't wanna go home 
This must be just like livin' in paradise
And I don't wanna go home

Dig it, dig it
Suzy, Suzy, girl, for cryin' out loud
You got all the right moves
You make me eat my heart out nightly
Aw  yeah

No special favors, make it out to cash
We'll spend it later, got to make this romance last
And 
That's it, that's it

Some folks say easy come is easy go 
But one night ain't enough for me
Girl, hang on tight and don't let go

This must be just like livin' in paradise 
And I don't wanna go home 
This must be just like livin' in paradise 
And I don't wanna go home, wow

Ho ho, ho
Aw yeah
Whoo

This must be just like livin' in paradise 
And I don't wanna go home 
This must be just like livin' in paradise 
And I don't wanna go home 

This must be just like livin' in paradise 
And I don't wanna go home  This must be just like livin' in paradise
