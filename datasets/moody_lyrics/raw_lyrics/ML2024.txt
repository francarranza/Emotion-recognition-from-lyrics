I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

Yes, I'm dreaming of a white, white Christmas
With, with every Christmas card I write
May your days be, be merry and bright
And may all your, your Christmases be white, be white

I, I'm dreaming of a white, white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be, be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I [Incomprehensible] all your Christmases
I hope all your Christmases to be white
I want your Christmases to be white

Jingle bells, Christmas carol
Children wishing your Christmases be white

I want your Christmases to be whiter
Your Christmas to be white
I want all your Christmases to be white
Every time it got to be white
When I'm [Incomprehensible]

Jingle bells, Christmas carol
Children wishing Christmases be white
I want all your Christmases to be white

Be white, may all your Christmases be, be white, white
I want your Christmases to be white
