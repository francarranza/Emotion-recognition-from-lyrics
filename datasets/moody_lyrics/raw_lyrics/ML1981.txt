So sorry
Running through the past to your door
I've been here before
Running to see what use I am for
Won't be here anymore
Heart after heart breaks
And you're left once more
Heart after heart breaks
Tears fall on the floor
Heart after heart breaks
What good am I for
Heart after heart breaks
What good am I for
