You bring me joy
When I'm down
Oh so much joy,
When I lose my way your love comes smilin' on me.

I saw your face and then I knew
We would be friends.
I was so afraid but your eyes, they'd say "Come to me".

So I'd say to you
"Can we talk for a while?"
You'd say "it's all right"
When you love me, I smile
I feel your heart and you feel mine
You bring me joy.

You bring me joy
Don't go too far away
If I can't see your face I will remember your smile

But can this be right
Oh and should we be friends
I get lonely sometimes
And I'm mixed up again
'Cause you're the finest thing I've seen in all my life
You bring me joy.

My joy - my joy
I believe this is gonna be what you want it to be
I just love you, I just, I love you oh can't you see
That you're the finest thing I've seen in all my life
You bring me joy

(My joy), you are, you're my joy
(My joy), my (you bring me joy) my joy

I, Thank you, baby, thank you, baby
(You bring me joy)
I just love you baby
I just love you baby
I, I just love you
When I lose my way your love comes smilin' on me.
