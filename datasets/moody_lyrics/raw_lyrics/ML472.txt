Joey, baby
Don't get crazy
Detours, fences
I get defensive

I know you've heard it all before
So I don't say it anymore
I just stand by
And let you fight your secret war

And though I used to wonder why
I used to cry till I was dry
Still sometimes
I get a strange pain inside

Oh Joey, if you're hurtin', so am I

Joey, honey
I've got the money
All is forgiven
Listen, listen

And if I seem to be confused
I didn't mean to be with you
And when you said I scared you
Well, I guess you scared me too

But we got lucky once before
And I don't wanna close the door
And if you're somewhere out there
Passed out on the floor

Oh Joey, I'm not angry anymore

And if I seem to be confused
I didn't mean to be with you
And when you said I scared you
Well, I guess you scared me too

But if it's love you're looking for
Then I can give a little more
And if you're somewhere drunk
And passed out on the floor

Oh Joey, I'm not angry anymore

Angry anymore
Angry anymore
