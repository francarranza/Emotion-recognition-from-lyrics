I give her all my love, that's all I do
And if you saw my love, you'd love her too
I love her

She gives me everything and tenderly
The kiss my lover brings, she brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours could never die
As long as I have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine, dark is the sky
I know this love of mine will never die
And I love her

Bright are the stars that shine, dark is the sky
I know this love of mine will never die
And I love her
