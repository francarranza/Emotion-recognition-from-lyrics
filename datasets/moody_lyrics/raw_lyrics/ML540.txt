Oh, please
You know, I never meant for this to happen
But if it's wrong, I just feel so right

You give me attention
You're someone who understands my needs
A man who is sensitive
Everything I miss at home
You know how to hold me
And do all the things I want to feel
Inside of each tender kiss
I get everything I miss at home

I was just out on the town in search of some fun
I wasn't looking for love
Then you came along and shared with me
All the things I miss at home

You give me attention
You're someone who understands my needs
A man who is sensitive
Everything I miss at home
You know how to hold me (Hold, hold me)
And do all the things I want to feel (Feel)
Inside of each tender kiss
I get everything I miss at home

Oh, yes, I do love someone
But I can't pretend to be the happy one
And be taking me for granted, I was lonely
Until you were there for me

You give me attention
You're someone who understands my needs
(Who understands me)
A man who is sensitive (A man)
Everything I miss at home
(Ooh, baby)
You know how to hold me
(I wanna hold you, baby)
And do all the things I want to feel
(Ooh, I wanna feel you, girl)
Inside of each tender kiss (Oh...)
I get everything I miss at home

Home is where the heart is, baby
And I'm at home
Things I miss at home
Home is where you let your feelings show
Everything that I loved
Things I miss at home
Until I met you, I felt all home
Things I miss at home
Now you've given me
Everything I miss at home

You're at home, baby
You give me attention
And you don't have to go nowehere, girl
Things I miss at home
Come and hold me tight
Things I miss at home
Closer, closer, baby, with all your might
You're giving me everything I miss at home
