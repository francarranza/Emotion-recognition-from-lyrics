I'm looking for that Lonely Street
I've got a sad sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called Lonely Street?

A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street?

Perhaps upon that Lonely Street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die

If I could find that Lonely Street
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street?
Where's this place called Lonely Street?
