I got what you want
If you want it
Come and get it

See this in my eyes
You can have it
Everything if you want it

I got your love in my pocket, your love x2

I don't want to feel like you extend your love for me, yeah
You can always figure it out all yourself away from me
But you know now know now know now
What you got x2

I can't say a word, there is nothing that we can't imagine
Just you wait and see I won't stop until you see, I will have it

I got your love in my pocket, your love x2                        

I don't want to feel like you extend your love for me, yeah
You can always figure it out all yourself away from me
But you know now know now 2x
What you got 3x
