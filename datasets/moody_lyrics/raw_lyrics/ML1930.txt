When I kiss your lips I just don't want to behave
My passion runs deeper and, girl, I'm not afraid
To bare my heart and soul and let it tumble all out
But if you say the word you'll have me talkin' about

When I kiss your lips, I just don't know where I stand
My passion runs deeper and things get out of hand
I'll bare my heart and soul and let it tumble all out
But if you say the word you'll have me talkin' about

(Too much passion) girl, whenever we touch
(Too much passion) girl, there's never too much
(Too much passion) girl, it's never enough
Too much passion is not enough
Too much passion is not enough

Whenever you touch me I feel a fire inside
My feelings that I have for you I just can't hide
I'll bare my heart and soul and let it tumble all out
But if you say the word you'll have me talkin' about

(Too much passion) girl, whenever we touch
(Too much passion) girl, there's never too much, oh yeah
(Too much passion) girl, it's never enough
Too much passion is not enough
Too much passion is not enough

When I kiss your lips I just don't want to behave
My passion runs deeper and, girl, I'm not afrid
To bare my heart and soul and let it all tumble out
But if you say the word you'll have me talkin' about

(Too much passion) girl, whenever we touch
(Too much passion) girl, there's never too much
(Too much passion) girl, it's never enough
Too much passion is not enough
Too much passion is not enough
Too much passion is not enough
Too much passion is not enough
Too much passion is not enough
Too much passion is not enough
Too much passion is not enough
Too much passion is not enough
Too much passion...
