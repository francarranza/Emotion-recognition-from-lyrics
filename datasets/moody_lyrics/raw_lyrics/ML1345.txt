You take the midnight subway train
You're callin' all the shots
You're struck by lightning
You're in love

You take the evening one on one
You're only livin' to have fun
You want to use me, take me home tonight
I'll make you wish that you were mine

You're struck by lightning
You're in love
It's not worth fighting
You're in love

Well turn around, remember me
I'm the one who's out and aimed to please
You're in love
You're in love

You make your livin' lovin' hot
You spin me like a top
You take the evening one on one 
You're only livin' to have fun

You're struck by lightning
You're in love
It's not worth fighting
You're in love

Well turn around, remember me
I'm the one who's out and aimed to please
You're in love 
You're in love

Well turn around 
Remember me 
Well turn around 
I'm the one who's out and aimed to please
