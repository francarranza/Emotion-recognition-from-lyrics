"They said your love life's in trouble in a magazine I read
When the one you love is hangin' off of his side of the bed
Baby, you're just barely hangin' on
Honey I know you'll soon be gone

And I don't need my palm read to know what lies ahead
I can see you in the arms of another girl instead
Baby this ain't the first time you've done it to me 
Honey it's gonna be the last time

And I know you think that I'll be goin' out of my mind
Crying you a river that winds and winds and winds
Oh but baby I'm down to my last teardrop this time

I don't care who or what you're doin'  
Ain't gonna be no more boohooin'
Baby this time I swear it's the truth
I ain't gonna cry no more for you
Uh-uh

Now I know where I'm goin' baby I know where I'm bound
I've been rearranging chairs on a ship that's goin' down
Baby, just step aside if you would
Honey, it's really over for good

And you might want to talk to me, you might want to call
But you won't hear nothin' out of me at all
Cause Baby, I ain't got nothin' left to say
Honey, I'll just be on my way

And I know you think that I'll be goin' out of my mind
Crying you a river that winds and winds and winds
Oh but baby I'm down to my last teardrop this time

I don't care who or what you're doin'  
Ain't gonna be no more boohooin'
Baby this time I swear it's the truth
I ain't gonna cry no more for you

And I know you that I'll be goin' out of my mind
Crying you a river that winds and winds and winds
Oh but baby I'm down to my last teardrop
Baby I'm down to my last teardrop
Baby I'm down to my last teardrop this time"
