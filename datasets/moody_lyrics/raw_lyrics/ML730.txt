I live the same old dream
Day and night
Memories of love I knew
I couldn't live my life or so it seemed
My heart cried out for only you

Oh I believe in love
But I believe in you
Things you do
I'm falling in love again with you
A broken heart could mend if given time
I know why love is forever
Love is forever with you

If every passing day I realize
And time will never heal the pain
You're all I've been thinking of
Everyone will fall in love again

I believe in love
I believe in you
Things you do
I'm falling in love again with you
A broken heart can mend if given time
I know why love is forever
Love is forever with you

Every road will lead me back to you again
My love
Oh I cried so many tears
I've been facing all the days without you
So tell me you care

Oh I believe in love
I believe in you
Things you do
I'm falling in love again with you
Tried to let it go but it wouldn't die
I know why Love is forever
Love is forever with you
