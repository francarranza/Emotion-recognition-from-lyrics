Still in love
I'm still in love
With you
Still in love, listen

Oh what can I do girl
So much in love girl
But your friends got you thinkin'
And it's affecting you

What can I do girl
So in love girl
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I don't wanna lose you

No what would I do without your love
Baby it's heaven sent from above
So you don't believe
What your friends tell you about me

I'm still the man for you
And I'm still the man that's true
And I'm still the man who's lucky
And I'm still in love with you

It don't matter what your friends do
They're just jealous of me and you
And I'll always keep you happy
'Cause I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love

Time passes so fast babe
I wish it would last babe
'Cause I know in my heart
That my life ends and starts with you

And baby I know that this feeling
I'm feeling just won't let me go away
'Cause you're the first true love I've ever known

So what would I do without your love
Baby it's heaven sent from above
And I know that in my heart
I'm the best for you

I'm still the man for you
And I'm still the man that's true
And I'm still the man who's lucky
And I'm still in love with you

It don't matter what your friends do
They're just jealous of me and you
And I'll always keep you happy
'Cause I'm still in love with you

Oh what can I do to write this love
I know that it makes me happy
To be in love with you so

And I'm still the man that's true
And I'm still the man who's lucky
