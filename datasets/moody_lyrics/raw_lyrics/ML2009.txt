I ain't talkin' 
Just to tease
People like you 
You don't grow 
On dreams
Look at you 
That's what 
It's gonna be
Have everything 
I need
Around my soul book 
Christmas tree

Merry Christmas
Happy New Year
I love you 
Have good cheer
I love you 
Good God

Got my baby
My precious love
Happiness, good God 
I got plenty of
Would you believe 
I got peace of mind
And I'll be groovin' 
At Christmas time

Merry Christmas 
Happy New Year
May you 
Have a good cheer
I love you 
James Brown love you
Your luck is so and so 
Missin' you
Brother love

Soulful Christmas 
Like a sweet melody
I'm a lucky you 
So and so
The bells 
Gonna ring for me

Merry Christmas 
And a happy New Year
To all of my fans
Have a good cheer
I love you, I love you 
Won't take nobody else
I can't stand myself 
Huh, good God

I got a heart 
Full of love 
For the whole wide world
And a little special love 
My little soulful girl
I got this feelin' every 
Every night and then
Gotta get ready 
Bring the New Year in

Merry Christmas 
And a happy New Year
All good cheer
There's one more thing
You've been 
So nice to me 
Down through the years
And I'll always 
Remember you 
Well 
I'll never forget

You bought my records 
Come to see my show
That's why 
James Brown love you so
You come to see my show
That's a debt 
That I'll always owe

Come to see my show 
See you at Christmas
Come to see my show 
See my show
