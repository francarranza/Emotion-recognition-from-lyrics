No more I'm taking this hatred from you
You make me feel dead when I'm talking to you
You'll take me for granted when I'm not around
So burn all your bridges 'cause I'm not going down

This time I will be heard
I'm not gonna burn
It's funny how the table,
How the table turns

You fake (fake) your damnation
You pray (pray) for salvation
'Cause your heart is made of stone
You can die and rot alone

I hope you're unhappy and hurting inside
I want you to choke when you swallow your pride
Lay in your coffin and sleep with your sins
Give me the nails and I'll hammer them in right now

This time you won't be heard
You are gonna burn
It's funny how the table,
How the table turns

You fake (fake) your damnation
You pray (pray) for salvation
'Cause your heart is made of stone
You can die and rot alone

You fake (fake) your damnation
You pray (pray) for salvation
'Cause your heart is made of stone
You can die and rot alone

This time you won't be heard
You are gonna burn
It's funny how the table,
How the table turns

You fake (fake) your damnation
You pray (pray) for salvation
'Cause your heart is made of stone
You can die and rot alone

You fake (fake) your damnation
You pray (pray) for salvation
'Cause your heart is made of stone
You can die and rot alone

You can die and rot alone
Just die and rot alone!

This time you won't be heard (x3)
