You keep calling me on the telephone
You say you're all alone; well, that's real sad
And you keep leavin' notes stuck on my door
Guess you're hungry for some more; girl, that's too bad.

'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet

Once there was this spider in my bed
I got caught up in her web of love and lies
She spun her chains around my heart and soul
Never to let go, oh, but I survived

'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet

Nothing left that you can do
To try and bring me 'round
'Cause everything you do just brings me down, whoa

And I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet

'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet

'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet

'Cause I ain't that lonely
