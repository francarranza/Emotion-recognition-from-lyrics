Here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs
And a flesh machine
He's gonna do another strip tease

Hey man, where'd y'get that lotion?
I've been hurting since I'm up again
About something called love
Yeah, something called love
Well, that's like hypnotizing chickens

Well, I'm just a modern guy
Of course, I've had it in the ear before
I have a lust for life
'Cause I've a lust for life

I'm worth a million in prizes
With my torture film
Drive a GTO
Wear a uniform
All on a government loan

I'm worth a million in prizes
Yeah, I'm through with sleeping on the sidewalk
No more beating my brains
No more beating my brains
With liquor and drugs
With liquor and drugs

Well, I'm just a modern guy
Of course, I've had it in the ear before
Well, I've a lust for life
'Cause of a lust for life

I got a lust for life 
Got a lust for life 
Oh, a lust for life 
Oh, a lust for life 

A lust for life 
I got a lust for life 
Got a lust for life

Well, I'm just a modern guy
Of course, I've had it in my ear before
Well, I've a lust for life
'Cause I've a lust for life

Well, here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs
And a flesh machine
I know he's gonna do another strip tease

Hey man, where'd y'get that lotion?
Your skin starts itching once you buy the gimmick
About something called love
Love, love, love
Well, that's like hypnotizing chickens

Well, I'm just a modern guy
Of course, I've had it in the ear before
And I've a lust for life
'Cause I've a lust for life

Got a lust for life
Yeah, a lust for life
I got a lust for life
A lust for life
Got a lust for life
Yeah, a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Lust for life
Lust for life
Lust for life
Lust for life
Lust for life
