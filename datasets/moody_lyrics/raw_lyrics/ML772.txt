Oh, it's opening time down on Fascination Street
So let's cut the conversation and get out for a bit
Because I feel it all fading and paling and I'm begging
To drag you down with me, to kick the last nail in

Yeah, I like you in that, like I like you to scream
But if you open your mouth, then I cannot be responsible
For quite what goes in or to care what comes out
So just pull on your hair, just pull on your pout

And let's move to the beat like we know that it's over
If you slip going under, slip over my shoulder
So just pull on your face, just pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time down on Fascination Street

So pull on your hair, pull on your pout
Cut the conversation, just open your mouth
Pull on your face, pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time down on Fascination Street

Down on Fascination Street
Down on Fascination Street
Down on Fascination Street
On Fascination Street
