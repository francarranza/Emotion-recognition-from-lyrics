So you tell me that I am a lucky man 
You're so right, yes you're so right
Girl you know, there is no other place I'd be right now
Holding hands with my baby 
So I'm going to love you until the sun comes up 
Be that extra sugar you need in your cup 

There's no holiday from this love
We won't take a break no
From this love

There's no holiday from this love
We won't take a break no
From this love

There's no holiday from this love
We won't take a break no
From this love

Not a day goes by when it's me alone
Like a soldier, can't wait to come back home 
And to let you know every man on earth wished they had you
For their special lady 
So am going to love you until the sun comes up 
Be that extra sugar I need in my cup 

There's no holiday from this love
We won't take a break no
From this love

There's no holiday from this love
We won't take a break no
From this love

There's no holiday from this love
We won't take a break no
From this love

So you tell me that I am a lucky man 
You're so right, yes you're so right
Girl you know, there is no other place I'd be right now
Holding hands with my baby 
So I'm going to love you until the sun comes up 
Be that extra sugar you need in your cup 

There's no holiday from this love
We won't take a break no
From this love

There's no holiday from this love
We won't take a break no
From this love

There's no holiday from this love
We won't take a break no
