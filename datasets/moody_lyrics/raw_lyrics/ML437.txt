Baby, ooh, baby, mm-gon' bring it on home to you
I've got my ticket, I've got that load
Join up, gone higher, all aboard
I'm-a take my seat, ride way back
Ooh, yeah, a-watch this train roll down the track
Gonna bring it on home, mm-bring it on home to you
Watch out, watch out, make me room

Try to tell you, baby, "Whatcha tryin' to do"
Try to love me, baby, love some other man, too
Bring it on home, bring it on home

Went a little walk downtown, honey, messed 'n got back late
Found a note there waitin', it said, "Daddy, I just can't wait"
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it back home, bring it back home to me, baby

Tell you, pretty baby, love to mess me 'round
I'm gonna give you lovin', baby, gonna move you outta town
Bring it on home, bring it on home

Sweetest little baby daddy ever saw
I'm gonna give you lovin', baby, I'm gonna give you more
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it on home, alright

Bring it on home, bring it on home to you
