You're not the kind


You say you're falling in love with me
That's why I sit here and cry
For that is something that never can be
And here's the reason why

For you're not the kind of a boy (girl) for a girl (boy) like me
'Cause I'm just a song and a dance, you're a symphony
You say that you never would doubt me
Well, I'm tellin' you, you'd be much better off without me
'Cause I'm just the kind of a girl (boy) who would never play fair
And you're just the kind of a boy (girl) who would always be square
It's so hard to let you go but it's only because I know
That you're not the kind of a boy (girl) for a girl (boy) like me

For you're not the kind of a boy (girl) for a girl (boy) like me
'Cause I'm just a song and a dance, you're a symphony
You say that you never would doubt me
Well, I'm tellin' you, you'd be much better off without me
'Cause I'm just the kind of a girl (boy) who would never play fair
And you're just the kind of a boy (girl) who would always be square
It's so hard to let you go but it's only because I know
That you're not the kind of a boy (girl) for a girl (boy) like me
