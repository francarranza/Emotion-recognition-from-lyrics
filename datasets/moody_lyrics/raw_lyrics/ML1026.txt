Out on the back porch
You stay tonight, we bring a pocket of pocket knives
You want to fight me
You want to fight
Forgotten sense of me
Say ah say ah
And in the backyard
Into the night
We walk through fire
My love is your flashlight
They want to fight me
They want to fight
Forgotten sense of me
Say ah say ah
Walk through the fire
Walk till it gets light
There is no hiding
To save your life
You've got to try
Say you'll mean it
Set your arms down
Say ah say ah
