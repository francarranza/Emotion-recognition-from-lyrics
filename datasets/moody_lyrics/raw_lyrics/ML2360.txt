I was a child
Who wanted love that was wild
Though tight as slow motion
But crazed with devotion

Insane with devotion
A whole other notion
I was fourteen and a half
And it wasn't no laugh

Love comes in spurts - oh no it hurts
Love comes in spurts - it hurts
Love comes in spurts - oh no, 'cause
Love comes in spurts - it always hurts

I just can't get wise
To those tragical lies
Though I now know the facts
They still cut like an axe

'Cause love comes in spurts
In dangerous flirts
And it murders your heart
They didn't tell you that part

Love comes in spurts
Love comes in spurts
Love comes in spurts
Love comes in spurts

Love comes in spurts
Love comes in spurts
Love comes in spurts
Love comes in spurts
