Do you hear revolution's call?
It's time to fight our own denial
Warmongers keep us locked in fear
Invoke the past, a moment of tears

An ugly truth
Put forth by our youth
Under the threat of patriotic brute, so

Use your rage
It is a weapon
We now must engage

Let trumpets sound our call
Or by their lies we will fall

Gnash down our teeth in hate and sing

Sing revolution's song
When they say die
Die for America

Solo: Flynn, Demmel

War!

They say that freedom isn't free
It's paid with the lives of sons and families
'Cause blood is their new currency
And oil pumps the heart of money

So fight as one
Without a fucking gun
Words are the bullets to this revolution

Use your pain
The battlegrounds, the streets are ablaze

Excess will pave their path
The winds of change, our bloodbath

Gnash down our teeth in hate and sing

Sing revolution's song
When they say die
Die for America

Power and prejudice
Actions they used to pit against
Terror, insurgency
Words used to scare conformity
It's propaganda, it's their hypocrisy
Free to choose our own slavery

All suffer humanity

Solo: Demmel, Flynn, Demmel, Flynn

Raise your hands...
Raise your fists and

Fight X?

So, Fight- for all that you love
Scream - choking with foot upon throat
Blind - star spangled eyes
Death - no more the truth you will hide
No, more

So how do they sleep?
While our mothers weep
They're selling our souls
And our blood for oil

Our generation
Can be the fucking one
That overcomes the greed
Of corrupt nations

Have no shame
You're not alone in thinking
This is fucking insane

Rise up and take your stand
And curl the fingers of your hand

And I don't know what to do
'Cause I don't have the answers
But with every ounce of strength
I'll vow to fight this cancer

Didn't say I want to lead
I just might let you down
Didn't say believe in me
Just hold this common ground

I'm just as lost as you
And probably more confused
So fucking far from perfect
My mind wrecked from abuse

There's something fucking wrong
When war takes sons and daughters
Our lambs misled to slaughter

War!
Clenching the fists of dissent
Lies!
Clenching the fists of dissent
Fear!
Clenching the fists of dissent
Change!
Clenching to hope
