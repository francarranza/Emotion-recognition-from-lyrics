Fantasize exploding hands
Archaic science
Master plan
Hear the war cry
Watch the crow fly
When your body's set
It never fails
Then you hear the tale of tales

Bound and gagged
You're in a reign of fire
Spells and magic
In the reign of fire

Complacency with all
A strong need to bathe in gall
Hear the war cry
Watch the crow fly

When your body's set
It never fails
Then you hear the tale of tales

Bound and gagged
You're in the reign of fire
Spells and magic
In the reign of fire
Feel the hexes
In the reign of fire
Find what sex is
In the reign of fire

I sold my soul
To give to you
I sold my soul 
Let me pull you through
Never fails
It never fails

Feel the hexes
In the reign of fire
Find what sex is
In the reign of fire
