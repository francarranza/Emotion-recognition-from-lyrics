Hello walls (hello hello) how things go for you today
Don't you miss her since she upped and walked away
And I'll bet you dread to spend another lonely night with me
But lonely walls I'll keep you company.

Hello window (hello hello) well I see that you're still here
Aren't you lonely since our darling disappeared
Well look here is that a teardrop in the corner of your pane
Now don't you try to tell me that it's rain.

She went away and left us all alone the way she planned
Yes, we'll have to learn to get along without her if we can
Hello ceiling (hello hello) I'm gonna stare at you a while
You know I can't sleep so won't you bear with me awhile.

We must all stick together or else I'll lose my mind
I've got a feeling she'll be gone a long, long time.
(Hello, hello)...
