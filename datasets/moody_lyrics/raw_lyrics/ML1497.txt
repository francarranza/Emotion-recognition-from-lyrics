We hope and pray love will find us
And we often stay in spite
All the shame we try to hide from the pain
I hope that you love again
And I want you to understand
You're my joy girl
My love won't fail you now


We said our goodbyes (baby)
And you're no longer mine (hey)
But remember one thing (hey girl)
My love for you will never fail

Have shame on you
And have shame on me

Staying here for so long
When we both know it was so wrong baby
I want for you something better
And I hope you do stay forever
In my heart girl
My love won't fail you now
But what we had would never last today baby
My love girl (yeah)
My love won't fail you now
In my heart you'll stay


Love never fails
