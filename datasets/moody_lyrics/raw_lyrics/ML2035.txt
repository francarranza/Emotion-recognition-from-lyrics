Take back the holly and mistletoe
Silver bells on a string
If I wrote a letter to Santa Claus
I would ask for just one thing

I don't need sleigh rides in the snow
I don't want a Christmas that's blue
Take back the tinsel, stockings and bows
'Cause all I want for Christmas is you

I don't need expensive things
They don't matter to me
What I want can't be found
Underneath the Christmas tree

You are the angel that tops my tree
You are my dream come true
Santa can't bring me what I need
'Cause all I want for Christmas is you

I don't need expensive things
They don't matter to me
What I want can't be found
Underneath the Christmas tree

You are the angel that tops my tree
You are my dream come true
Santa can't bring me what I need
'Cause all I want for Christmas is you

All I want for Christmas is you
