It was a cold California,
Even in the summer,
She was wrapped in a blanket by the pool,
There were rapid statements,
About life commitments,
A sense of heat that I couldn't bare to touch,
I couldn't bare it.

It's not your fault so please stop your crying now,
It's not your fault so please stop your crying now,
Please stop your crying now,
Woah,
Woah.

There was staring and seclusion,
A fine tuned way of motion,
A face wrapped for a suitor,
The sound of hearts pumping at the same beat,
Coming 'round the corner,
In almost all directions,
A sense of heat that I couldn't bare to touch,
No, I couldn't bare it.

It's not your fault so please stop your crying now,
(It's not your fault so please stop your crying now)
It's not your fault so please stop your crying now,
(It's not your fault so please stop your crying)

Now you, wait for, something, to cure this,
Well I'm here, under your downpour.

No, woah.

It's not your fault so please stop your crying now,
It's not your fault so please stop your crying,
It's not your fault.

It's not your fault so please stop your crying now,
(It's not your fault so please stop your crying now)
It's not your fault so please stop your crying now,
(No, woah)
It's not your fault so please stop your crying now,
(No woah, no woah) (It's not your fault so please stop your crying now),
It's not your fault, stop crying now,
(No...)
