Tell me just what happened
Let me get this down
But I'd better hear the same thing
When I ask around
No one's calling you a liar but
There's no smoke without fire

The alibi you sold me
You know it ain't water tight
A little birdie told me
And I got you dead to right
No one's calling you a liar but
There's no smoke without fire

Darling please believe me
Cross my heart you said
But when I turned around
You had your fingers crossed instead
No one's calling you a liar but
There's no smoke without fire

Now I'm a one-man jury
I got all the facts
Do you want to change your story
Before the judge gets back
No one's calling you a liar but
There's no smoke without fire
