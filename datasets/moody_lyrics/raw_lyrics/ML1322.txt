Kid
What changed your mood?
You got all sad
So I feel sad too
I think I know
Some things
You never outgrow

You think it's wrong
I can tell you do
How can I explain
When you don't want me to?

Kid
My only kid
You look so small
You've gone so quiet
I know you know
What I'm about
I won't deny it

But you forget
You don't understand
You've turned your head
You've dropped my hand

All my sorrows
All my blues
All my sorrows

Shut the light
Go away
Full of grace
You cover your face

Kid
Precious kid
Your eyes are blue
But you won't cry I know
Angry tears
Are too dear
You won't let them go
