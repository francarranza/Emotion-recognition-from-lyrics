Life isn't easy from the singular side
Down in the hole, some emotions are hard to hide
It's your decision, it's a chance that you take
It's on your head, it's a habit that's hard to break

Do you need a friend?
Would you tell no lies?
Would you take me in?
Are you lonely in the dark?
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark

You never listen to the voices inside
They fill your ears as you run to a place to hide
You're never sure if the illusion is real
You pinch yourself but the memories are all you feel

Can you break away 
From your alibis?
Can you make a play?
Oh, will you meet me in the dark?
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark

Don'tcha need me, hey, hey
Don'tcha need me, oh yeah
Don'tcha leave me, hey, hey
Don'tcha need me, oh yeah

You take no interest, no opinion's too dear
You make the rounds, oh, you try to be so sincere
You guard your hopes and you pocket your dreams
You'd trade it all to avoid an unpleasant scene

Can you face the fire 
When you see me there?
Can you feel the fire?
Will you love me in the dark?
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
