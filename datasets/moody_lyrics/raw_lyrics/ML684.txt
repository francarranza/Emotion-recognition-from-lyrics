Tonight you're mine
Completely
You give your love
So sweetly
Tonight the light
Of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?

Is this a lasting
Treasure
Or just a moment's
Pleasure?
Can I believe
The magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words
Unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart
Be broken
When the night
(When the night..)
Meets the mor-
(Meets the mor..)
-Ning sun

I'd like to know
That your love
Is love I can
Be sure of
So tell me now
And I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
