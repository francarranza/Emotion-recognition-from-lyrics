You may think me very naive
Taken as true
I only see what I want to see

Avoid eye contact at all costs
What can I do
To see your fine teeth smiling at me

So I'm standing here so lonely
What can I do
But learn to laugh at myself

You might say
That we should build a city of tears
All I'm saying
Is I'm alone and consequently
Only my tears satisfy the real need of my heart
I resist

Falling and laughing
Falling and laughing
Falling and laughing
Falling and laugh - ing
