Take me into the seas
So I can clean off this disease
Death will complete me
It's what I need

Take my evil to the skies
Take my evil, all light dies

Shattering the skies above
I want to destroy all that you love
Shattering the skies above
I won't rest till I am drenched in blood

Take me into the seas
So I can clean off this disease
Death will complete me
It's what I need

Take my evil to the skies
Take my evil, all light dies

Shattering the skies above
I want to destroy all that you love
Shattering the skies above
I won't rest till I am drenched in blood

Take my evil to the skies
Take my evil, all light dies

Shattering the skies above
I want to destroy all you love
I'm shattering 
Shattering the skies above 
I won't rest till I'm drenched in blood 
I'm shattering

Take my evil to the skies
Take my evil, all light dies

Shattering the skies above
I want to destroy all that you love
Shattering the skies above
I won't rest till I am drenched in blood

Shattering the skies above
Shattering the skies above
