I ain't never been with a woman long enough
For my boots to get old
We've been together so long now
They both need resoled

If I ever settle down
You'd be my kind
And it's a good time for me
To head on down the line

Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

I'm the kinda man likes to get away
Like to start dreaming about
Tomorrow, today
Never said that I love you
Even though it's so
Where's that duffel bag of mine?
It's time to go

Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

I'm gonna be leaving
At the break of dawn
Wish you could come
But I don't need no woman tagging along
I'll sneak out that door
Couldn't stand to see you cry
I'd stay another year if I saw teardrops in your eyes

Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

I never had a damn thing, but what I had
I had to leave it behind
You're the hardest thing
I ever tried to get off my mind
Always something greener on the other side of that hill
I was born a wrangler and a rounder
And I guess I always will

Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong
