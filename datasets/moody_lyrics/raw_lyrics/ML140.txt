Tongue tied or short of breath, don't even try
Try a little harder
Something's wrong, I'm not naive, you must must be strong
Ooh, baby, try

Hey, girl
Move a little closer

You're too shy, shy
Hush hush, eye-to-eye
Too shy, shy
Hush hush, eye-to-eye

Too shy, shy
Hush hush, eye-to-eye
Too shy, shy
Hush hush

Modern medicine falls short of your complaint
Ooh, try a little harder
You're moving in circles, won't you dilate?
Ooh, baby, try

Hey, girl
Move a little closer

'Cause you're too shy, shy
Hush hush, eye-to-eye
Too shy, shy
Hush hush, eye-to-eye

Too shy, shy
Hush hush, eye-to-eye
Too shy, shy
Hush hush

Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-do, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-do, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-do, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-do, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo

You're too shy, shy
Hush hush, eye-to-eye
Too shy, shy
Hush hush, eye-to-eye

Too shy, shy
Hush hush, eye-to-eye
Too shy, shy
Hush hush

You're too shy, shy
Hush hush, eye-to-eye
Too shy, shy
Hush hush, eye-to-eye

Too shy, shy
Hush hush, eye-to-eye
Too shy, shy
Hush hush

Too shy, shy
Hush hush, eye-to-eye
Too shy, shy
Hush hush, eye-to-eye

Too shy, shy
