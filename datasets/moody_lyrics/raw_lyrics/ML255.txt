Unbelievable, I'm blown away it's true
By the matchless love that I've found in You
Undeniable, the change in me
I've never felt so free
It makes me want to dance
You make me want to dance
When I think about how

You love me, You love me,
You love me just the way I am
You love me, You love me,
You love me just the way,
Just the way I am

Ever patiently accepting me
Lord, You love in spite of everything I do
But oh so faithfully
You're committed to the process that makes me like You
And I feel like I can dance
Oh You make me want to dance
When I think about how

You love me, You love me,
You love me just the way I am
You love me, You love me,
You love me just the way,
Just the way I am (2x)

Not when I'm good enough
Not when I clean my act up
Not when I cross that line the thousandth time
And become a better man
Your grace is more than enough
To cover all my sins You washed them away
So right here today
You love me just the way I am
And You make me want to dance

You love me, You love me,
You love me just the way I am
You love me, You love me,
You love me just the way,
Just the way I am (2x)
