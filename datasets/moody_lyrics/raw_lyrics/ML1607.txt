Trash, won't pick it up, take them lights away
Trash, won't pick it up, don't take your life away
Trash, won't pick it up, don't try to take my knife away
And please, don't you ask me if I love you
If you don't know what I'm doing
What you know is

Trash, won't pick it up, take them lights away
Trash, won't get it up, don't throw your love away
Trash, don't pick it up, don't try to take my knife away
And please, don't you ask me if I love you
Cause I don't know why I do
All's I know is

Trash, won't pick it up, take them lights away
Trash, won't pick it up, don't take my knife away
Trash, won't pick it up, forgot to take them all away
And please, don't you ask me if I love you
Cause I don't know if I do

I want to wipe it out here with you
And take a lover's leap with you
I'll go to fairyland with you
I'll go to heaven blue with you
But I just don't know if I do
I just don't know if I do

Ah, how you call your loverboy

Trash, pick it up, take them lights away
Trash, go pick it up, go put that knife away
Trash, go pick it up, don't give your life away
Trash, get it up, don't throw your love away
Trash, pick it up, don't take my knife away
Trash, pick it up, try to take them all away
Trash, pick it up, don't take my knife away

Oh, Trash, whoa-whoa, my sweet baby, yeah-yeah
Oh, oh, Trash, whoa-whoa, baby, you're the one

Trash, pick it up, take them lights away
Trash, go pick it up, don't take my knife away
Trash, go pick it up, oh take them lights away
Trash, go pick it up, don't take my knife away

Oh Trash, don't take my knife away
Oh Trash, don't take my knife away
Oh Trash, don't take my knife away
Oh Trash
