This is times of battle,
This is times of war,
This is time for discipline,
No mercy for a war whore.
Life turns harsh,
But lust does not disappear,
Life turns dark,
But attraction is still there.
To taste the forbidden,
To dance with the wolves,
Erotic deceit,
Pleasure above rules.
This is times of battle,
This is times of war,
This is time for discipline,
No mercy for a war whore.
This game, this flirt, will come to an end
Power will change,
Our nation will rise again,
The hordes will scream for your death,
They will claim revenge,
They will ravage your body,
They will serve you hell.
Spitting in the eyes of your defenders,
With open legs you surrender,
Embracing the muscular overpower,
Our pride you so simply devour.
It is time of battle,
It is time of war,
It is time to be disciplined,
No mercy for a war whore.
