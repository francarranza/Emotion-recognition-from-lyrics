Go to sleep my son
This manger for Your bed
You have a long road before You
Rest Your little head

Can you feel the weight of Your glory
Do You understand the price
Or does the Father guard Your heart for now
So You can sleep tonight

Go to sleep my son
Go and chase Your dreams
This world can wait for one more moment
Go and sleep in peace

I believe the glory of heaven 
Is lying in my arms tonight
But Lord I ask that He for just this moment
Simply be my child

Go to sleep my son
Baby close Your eyes
Soon enough You'll save the day
But for now dear child of mine
Oh my Jesus sleep tight
