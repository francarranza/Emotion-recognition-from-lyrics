You and me could it be meant to be
Nothing's wrong when I'm with you
The ice in me is melting rapidly
Now I'm a believer too

Up all night I shiver with delight
Everytime I hear your song
I can't believe you're everything I need
Mama you can do no wrong

I wish I knew everything it takes to get along
Then we should take it easy or we will both be sorry
Then we should take it easy, take it easy
Or we both be sorry
Let's take it easy

Sometimes I think about what I would do without
Who knew we could be such friends?
Dreaming of your love and warm and touch
When can I see you again?

Up all night I shiver with delight
Everytime I hear your song
Dizzy with anticipation
How's everything coming along?

I wish I could do whatever it takes to get along
Then we should take it easy or we will both be sorry
Then we should take it easy, take it easy
Or we will both be sorry, or we will both be sorry
