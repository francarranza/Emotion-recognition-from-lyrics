I think I died this time
Suffered bullet holes
And stab wounds in my side
I think I'm solving crime
I've got a couple of clues
And a hunch that swells like a fool boy

Time, make time for us, make time for us
Can't even sing for words
You know I'm far too shameful
It's not fair

I think I've lost my math
I've got some figures and facts
And other clues that help follow your tracks
I think I've lost my legs
Knowing me they're sittin' at the bottom of the deep blue sea

Make time for us, make time for us
Can't even sing for words
You know I'm far too shameful

Ships with, ships with holes will sink
And I will swim
Ships with, ships with holes will sink
And I will

Ships with, ships with holes will sink
And I will swim
Swim

Make time for us, make time for us
Can't even sing for words
You know I'm far too shameful
It's not fair

Make time for us, time for us
Can't even sing for words
You know I'm far too shameful
It's not fair

Make time for us, make time for us
Can't even shout for words
You know I'm far too shameful
It's not fair

Make time for us, make time for us
Can't even sing for words
You know I'm far too shameful
