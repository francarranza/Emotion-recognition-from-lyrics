I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Oh, how I wanna go home

Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
And I dreamed about those cotton fields and home
I dreamed about my mother
Dear old papa, sister, and brother
I dreamed about that girl
Who's been waiting for so long

I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Oh, how I wanna go home

Homefolks think I'm big in Detroit City
From the letters that I write, they think I'm fine
By day, I make the cars
By night, I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines


'Cause you know, I rode the freight train north to Detroit City
And after all these years, I find I just been wastin' my time
So I just think I'll take my foolish pride
And put it on a Southbound freight and ride
And go on back to the loved ones
The ones I left waitin' so far behind

I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Oh, how I wanna go home
