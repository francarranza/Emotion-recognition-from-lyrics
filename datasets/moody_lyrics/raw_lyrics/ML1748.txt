Any time that we're together
I can't keep my eyes off you
Did you know it's you I treasure
Doin' anything you want me, anything you ask me to

I never ever had a love so true
Someone as warm as you
All I know is that I love you
Give all my love to you, that's all I wanna do

Gonna write a little love song, yeah
Gonna tell you how I feel
Gonna write a little love song
Show you how I care for you, I'll keep on loving you

Gonna write a little love song
Wanna show you how I feel, baby
That's why I'm writing you this love song
Promise that I care for you, show you that my love is true

I love the way you say you love me
I love to hear it when you say
That you're always thinking of me
Every day's a special day, that's why I feel this way, yeah

You always seem to make me happy
You always greet me with a smile
That's why I'm writing you this love song
Somehow I already knew when I laid eyes on you

Gonna write a little love song
Gonna tell you how I feel
Gonna write a little love song
Show you how I care for you, I'll keep on loving you

Gonna write a little love song
Wanna show you how I feel, girl
That's why I'm writing you this love song
Promise that I care for you, show you that my love is true

Gonna write a little love song
Gonna tell you how I feel
Gonna write a little love song
Show you how I care for you, I'll keep on loving you

Gonna write a little love song
Wanna show you how I feel, baby
That's why I'm writing you this love song
Promise that I care for you, show you that my love is true
