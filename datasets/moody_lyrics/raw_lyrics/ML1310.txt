Hello
Naw I'll be there in a minute
But I got something to do
What
You should know there's one main thing and its

When I hustle
Baby I be thinkin' of u
Always on my grind
Spending alot of time
Like we use to do
Now I be out in these streets
Cause baby we gotta eat and you know that's the truth
When I'm out on my hustle I'm comin' home to u

Yeah I'm a hustler
But baby girl I wanna ***** with her
U the type to make a thug nigga turn love with her
Mami let me tell u
I ain't nothin' like these other scrubs
It h.u.e.y
Count boi he fly
Got money to the hizi
That y I fly g5
So if any brotha tell you he could better he lied
Look I ain't nelly
But I could make you hollae.i
When we f.u.c.k.i.n.g in the tree top
Bet you would feel better than ever when we ride
Cop u a summer wardrobe in the spring time

More we around gratifies me to love u
But you should know there one main thing and that's

Baby girl you be my queen
The only thing make a thug smile in his dreams
Or make me feel I ain't as thug as I seem
When we make love you get weak in the knees
The only female who do what she pleased
But say she ain't trickin when I gettin' her jeans
Car when verrumum a safe in the streets
I tell you mami don't worry I'm safe with the heat
Now come a lil closer move ur waist to the beat
In the window of my comfort for heat when you sleep
There's no other couple ******** with me

(Verse 3: lloyd)
I then gone around the world before
And I know you the one for me
Ur the one baby
Just lay down you'll see
Shawty I could make you see
I'm not gone ride these streets no more
Could girl its ride or die
Girl its ride or die
Imma get you right
