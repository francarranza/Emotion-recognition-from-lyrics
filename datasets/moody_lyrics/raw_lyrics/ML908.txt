I wanna be with you all the time 
Every day 
Every night 
You're my deja vu 

It's sounds obsessive 
But I think it's fine 
When you're gone all I do is to think of you 

I live and love with you 
This charming life 

I live and love with you 
This charming life 

You know you came into the room alone 
But when you left 
Then I found that you took my heart 
It sounds so corny yes I know it does 
But truth is the shade that I choose to wear 

I live and love with you 
This charming life 

I live and love with you 

This charming life 

Every government must pass down a law 
That says the sun has to always shine 
That everybody gets the chance to say 

I live and love with you 
This charming life 

I live and love with you 
This charming life 

Every morning when I open my eyes 
You're the first thing that I see 
Lady luck she really took to me 

Because 
I live and love with you 
This charming life 

I live and love with you 
This charming life
