Home for the holidays,
I believe I've missed each and every face
Come on and play one easy
Let's turn on the love lights in the place
It's time I found myself
Totally surrounded in your circles
Oh my friends

Please celebrate me home
Give me a number
Please celebrate me home
Play me one more song
That I'll always remember
I can recall whenever I
Find myself too all alone
I can sing me home

Uneasy highway
Traveling where the westerly winds can fly
Somebody try to tell me
But the man forgot to tell me why
I gotta count on being gone
Come on mama
Come on daddy
Hear what you want from me yeah
I'll be strong and
I'll be weak

Please celebrate me home
Give me a number
Please celebrate me home
Play me one more song
That I'll always remember
I can recall whenever I
Find myself too all alone
I can sing me home

(I can make believe I've never gone)
(I never know where I belong)

Please celebrate me home
Give me a number
Please celebrate me home
Play me one more song
That I'll always remember
I can recall whenever I
Find myself too all alone
I can sing me home
