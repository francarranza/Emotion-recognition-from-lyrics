I got a little boogie but it ain't too clean
It's real low down and it's kinda mean
The dirty boogie
The dirty boogie
When I get low down, it's the dirty boogie for me

The dirty boogie
What's it called?
The dirty boogie
Hey you all

The dirty boogie
How's it go?
The dirty boogie
Not too slow
When I get low down, it's the dirty boogie for me

Well you rattle and shake, you moan and groan
A girl like you I could never bring home
The dirty boogie
The dirty boogie
When I get low down, it's the dirty boogie for me

The dirty boogie
What's it called?
The dirty boogie
Hey you all

The dirty boogie
How's it go?
The dirty boogie
Not too slow
When I get low down, it's the dirty boogie for me

They're shakin' their hips and scream and shout
And doin' things I can't even talk about
The dirty boogie
Catch my drift
The dirty boogie
When I get low down, it's the dirty boogie for me

The dirty boogie
What's it called?
The dirty boogie
Hey you all

The dirty boogie
How's it go?
The dirty boogie
Not too slow
When I get low down, it's the dirty boogie for me
