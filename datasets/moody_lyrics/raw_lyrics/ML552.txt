I need you, I need you

In the morning
Will you be there in the morning
To love me
Love me
Love me
I don't know what it is about your love
And what you've got that keeps me running back to you
Telling me lies saying things that will keep me from leaving
Be a man not a boy running from the truth
You're always

Leaving late at night
You never come home
And when we have a fight
'Cause you're doing me wrong
Still I can't leave
You're leaving me wondering
Will you be there
In the morning
(Repeat)

Will you be there in the morning
Will you be there
To love me
(Repeat)

Love me
Love me
I need you here with me
In the morning
Morning
Will you be there
To love me
(Repeat)

Love me
Love me
I don't know what it is about our love
And ll of my friends say I'm crazy waiting here for you
We got a love so strong and I can't see me leaving
They don't understand the things that we go through
I'm always
Telling you come home
'Cause I need you here
And you're hanging out all night long
And you disappear
Still I can't leave
You leaving me wondering
Will you be there
In the morning
Will you be there
Will you be there in the morning
I need you right here with me
To love me
To love me
Love me
Love me
Love me
In the morning
In the morning baby I need you here
