I don't want you be no slave
I don't want you work all day
I don't want 'cause I'm sad and blue
I just want to make love to you, baby
Love to you, baby
Love to you, baby
Love to you

I don't want you cook my bread
I don't want you make my bed
I don't want your money too
I just want to make love to you, baby
Love to you, baby
Love to you, baby
Love to you

Well I can tell by the way that you twitch and walk
See by the way that you baby talk
Know by the way that you treat your man
I can love you, baby, till the night train

I don't want you wash my clothes
I don't want you leave the home
I don't want 'cause I'm sad and blue
I just want to make love to you, baby
Love to you, baby
Love to you, baby
Love to you, yeah

I don't want you wash my clothes
I don't want you leave the home
I don't want 'cause I'm sad and blue
I just want to make love to you, baby
Love to you, baby
Love to you, baby
Sweet love to you, baby

Love to you, baby
I just wanna make love to you, baby
Love to you, baby
Love to you, baby
Love to you
I just, I just want to make love to you, baby
I just want to make love
