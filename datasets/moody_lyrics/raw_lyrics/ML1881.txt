Hey baby boy, is your mama home?
Did she go away and leave you all alone?
I got a bad desire
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire

Tell me now, baby, is she good to you?
Does she do to you things that I do?
I'm gonna take you higher
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull
And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my soul
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire

And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire

Yeah, I'm on fire
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire
