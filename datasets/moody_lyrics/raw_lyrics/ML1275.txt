Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
And think of you
Turning in circles confusion--
Is nothing new
Flashback to warm nights--
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories,
Time after--

Sometimes you picture me--
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear
What you have said--
And you say--go slow--
I've fall behind--
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look--and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you--I will be waiting
Time after time
Time after time

After your picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows--I'm wondering
If you're OK
You say--go slow--
I fall behind--
The drum beats out of time--

If you're lost you can look--and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you--I will be waiting
Time after time

Time after time
(Time after time)
Time after time
Time after time
(Time after time)
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
(Time after time)
Time after... time (time)
