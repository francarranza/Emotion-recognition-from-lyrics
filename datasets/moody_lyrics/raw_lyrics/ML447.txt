Sexy baby, good loving daddy
Let me be your rocking chair
Just rock me away from here
Let's get in on; come to me baby
Let me be your rocking chair
Just rock me away from here

Let your arms shelter me from all hurt and pain
Light my heart with your everlasting flame

Sexy baby, good loving daddy
Let me be your rocking chair
Rock me away from here
Let's get it on; come to me baby
Let me be your rocking chair
Rock me away from here

Rock me gently;
Make me feel like a cloud in the sky
Whisper softly;
Let my heart take wing and fly

Sexy baby, good loving daddy
Let me be your rocking chair
Just rock me away from here
Let's get it on; come to me honey
Let me be your rocking chair
Rock me away from here

Just rock me baby
In my rocking chair, baby
All night long till the morning comes
Just you, baby
Just rock me hun; rock me baby
Till the midnight hour
In my rocking chair
All night long
Come on baby, sexy baby
Let me be your rocking chair
Just rock me away from here
Come on baby, sexy honey
Let me be your rocking chair
Just rock me away from here
Rock me baby
