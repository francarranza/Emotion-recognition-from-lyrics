Brother jukebox, sister wine.
Mother freedom, father of time.
Since she left me by myself,
You're the only family I've got left.

I go down to that same old cafe,
Where I try to wash my troubles away.
I'm still down, and I'm still all alone,
But it beats staying home all night long.

Brother jukebox, sister wine.
Mother freedom, father of time.
Since she left me by myself,
You're the only family I've got left.

I go home and I climb that old stairway.
And I tell myself: "Tomorrow's a new day."
But I know I'll just go down again,
And spend my time with my new next-of-kin.

Brother jukebox, sister wine.
Mother freedom, father of time.
Since she left me by myself,
You're the only family I've got left.

Brother jukebox, sister wine.
Mother freedom, father of time.
Since she left me by myself,
You're the only family I've got left.

You're the only family I've got left.
