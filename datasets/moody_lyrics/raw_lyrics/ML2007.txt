When you're driving down the highway at night
And you're feelin' that Wild Turkey's bite
Don't give Johnny Walker a ride
Cause Jack Black is right by your side
You might get taken to the jailhouse and find
You've been arrested for driving while blind

Now, just the other night with nothin' to do
We broke a case of proof 102
And started itchin' for that wonderful feel
Of rollin' in an automobile
You could say we was out of our mind
And let me tell you we were flyin' while blind

Then they had us up against the wall 
Hey, it's only blood grain alcohol
And there ain't no cause for alarm
We ain't out to do nobody no harm
How could anyone be so unkind
To arrest a man for drivin' while blind
