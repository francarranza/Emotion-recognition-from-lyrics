Long nights, no sleep
Let's not turn alarm clocks on
Calls wait on my machine
Papers piling up on the front lawn

Love and happiness ruined my ambition
Love and happiness
Love and happiness, that's my condition
Love love love love and happiness

Take your time, stay for breakfast
And tell me why that tattoo
Why drive home this morning?
My shirt looks good on you

Love and happiness ruined my ambition
Love and happiness
Love and happiness, that's my condition
Love love love love and happiness

Who's the president?
I don't care
Who's the monkey, who's the mayor
What's the story
What's the news
What's the difference
All I want is you

I don't want to leave this feeling
I don't want to leave this house
I turned myself in with you and
Only you can turn me out

Love and happiness ruined my ambition
Love and happiness
Love and happiness, that's my condition
Love love love love love
Love and happiness
Love love love love love and happiness
