In the middle of a gun fight
In the center of a restaurant
They say
Come with your arms raised high

Well they're never gonna get me
I'm like a bullet through a flock of doves
To wage this war against your faith in me
Your life will never be the same
On your mother's eyes, say a prayer
Say a prayer

Now
But I can't
And I don't know
How we're just two men as God had made us
Well I can't
Well I can, yeah yeah

Too much, too late or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish
I'll kiss your lips again, yeah

They all cheat at cards and the checkers are lost
My cellmate's a killer
They make me do push-ups in drag
But nobody cares if you're losing yourself
Am I losing myself?

And well, I miss my Mom
Will they give me the chair?
Or lethal injection
Or swing from a rope, if you dare
Oh, nobody knows all the trouble I seen

Now
But I can't
And I don't know
How we're just two men as God had made us
Well I can't
Well I can, yeah yeah

Too much, too late or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish
I'll kiss your lips again, yeah

To your room
What they ask of you
They'll make you want to say
So long
But I don't remember
Why remember
You

Do you have the keys to the hotel?
'Cause I'm gonna set this motherfucker on fire
Fire

Life is but a drink for the dead
And well I, I won't go down by myself
But I'll go down with my friends

Now now now now
(Well I can't explain it)
Now now now
(Can't complain it)
Now now now
