Just you and I
Sharing our love together
And I know in time
We'll build the dreams we treasure
We'll be all right, just you and I

Just you and I
Just you and I
Sharing our love together
And I know in time
And I know in time
We'll build the dreams we treasure
And we'll be all right
Just you and I

And I remember our first embrace
That smile that was on your face
The promises that we made
And now your love is my reward
And I love you even more
Than I ever did before

Just you and I
Just you and I
We can entrust each other
With you in my life
With you in my life
They'll never be another
We'll be all right
Just you and I

And I remember our first embrace
That smile that was on your face
The promises that we made
And now your love is my reward
And I love you even more
Than I ever did before

We made it you and I
