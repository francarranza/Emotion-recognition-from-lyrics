I know you want to leave
Been holdin' on to you
Beggin? you to play this game
You've already won
I don't hate to beg you for your empty arms
If that's all I can get
Hurt me one more night
Just pretend you love me
I'll show you happiness I'll prove you need my love
And I'll bend over backwards to tell you every word you want to hear
Whatever you might need to reconsider what I'm giving say the word
Hurt me one more night
Just pretend you love me
I'll guess I've done
All I can do; It's really true

I'm lost in you; It's over
If you would change your devil mind
I'll even let you be more unkind if you want to
I'm fallin' on my knees
I know you're getting closer
To the door that opens your world
And all that makes me colder
If you could spear another chance to dance you
And lock me in your arms
Abuse me one more night
And pretend you love me
