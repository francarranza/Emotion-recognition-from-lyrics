So we all are growing old and it's getting old
Pressure on our hollow bones and the varicose
Suddenly we decompose but we're not alone, we're home
So we all are growing old

Maybe we're sealed in silence
And maybe we feel a guidance
Maybe your own devices
Will keep you afraid and cold

But I memorized your smile lines when lips divide
Kept alive your childlike reaction time
We're allowed to expire with ourselves in mind
So we all are growing old

Put out the fear of silence
And put out the need for guidance
And put out your own devices
And don't be afraid of the cold

And we sing, we sing, we sing
We fight, we fight, we fight
And we cry, we cry, we cry
And we slide, we slide, we slide into the light

Do we sing, we fight, we cry
We slide, we slide, we slide into the light

Maybe we're sealed in silence
And maybe we feel the guidance
Maybe your own devices
Will keep you afraid and cold
We'll put out the fear of silence
And put out the need for guidance
Put out your own devices
And don't be afraid of the cold
Afraid of the cold, afraid all the time
We've got nowhere to go but here
