Happy Christmas, Kyoko
Happy Christmas, Julian

And so this is Christmas 
And what have you done?
Another year over 
And a new one just begun 
And so this is Christmas 
I hope you have fun 
The near and the dear ones 
The old and the young 

A very merry Christmas 
And a happy New Year 
Let's hope it's a good one 
Without any fear 

And so this is Christmas (War is over) 
For weak and for strong (If you want it) 
For rich and the poor ones (War is over) 
The road is so long (Now)
And so Happy Christmas (War is over) 
For black and for white (If you want it) 
For yellow and red ones (War is over) 
Let's stop all the fight (Now)

A very merry Christmas 
And a happy New Year 
Let's hope it's a good one 
Without any fear 

And so this is Christmas (War is over)
And what have we done? (If you want it) 
Another year over (War is over)
And a new one just begun (Now)
And so Happy Christmas (War is over) 
We hope you have fun (If you want it)
The near and the dear one (War is over) 
The old and the young (Now) 

A very merry Christmas 
And a happy New Year 
Let's hope it's a good one 
Without any fear 

War is over if you want it 
War is over now

(Happy Christmas! Happy Christmas!)
