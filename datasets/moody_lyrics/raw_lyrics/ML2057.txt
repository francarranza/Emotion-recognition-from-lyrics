You know I'm a dreamer
But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low

Just when things went right
It doesn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song and you'll never feel
Left all alone

Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm coming off this long and winding road

I'm on my way
Well, I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home

You know that I've seen
To many romantic dreams
Up in lights, falling 
Off the silver screen

My hearts like an open book
For the whole world to read
Sometimes nothing
Keeps me together at the seams

I'm on my way
Well, I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way
Just set me free
Home sweet home

I'm on my way
Well, I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Well, I'm on my way
Just set me free
Home sweet home
