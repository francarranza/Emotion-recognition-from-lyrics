When whippoorwills call
And evening is nigh
I hurry to my blue heaven
Just a turn to the right
You'll find a little white light
Will lead you to my Blue Heaven

You'll see a smiling face
A fireplace, a cozy room
A little nest that nestles
Where the roses bloom
Just Marley and me
And the baby makes three
We're happy in my blue heaven

You'll see a smiling face
A fireplace, a cozy room
A little nest that nestles
Where the roses bloom
Just Marley and me, and baby makes three
We're happy in my blue heaven
We're so happy in my blue heaven
