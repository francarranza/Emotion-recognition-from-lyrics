(v 1)

I've been with 9s and 10s
Some come around again
I've seen a dime or two
They don't compare to you
So many things I like
Too many to even name
I wanna be your man
I hope you feel the same

Baby all I wanna do is hold you
And show you how much I adore you
Want you, need you
Baby, you're ... you're my favorite girl
Baby you're the only one
I wanna give you the world

Yeah, you're ... you're my favorite girl
You really really got it going on
Everything that a man could ever want
You're my favorite girl
Hmm, you're my favorite girl

(v 2)

Girl no more playing games
I'm done with other dames
I figure what's the use, there's really no excuse
Many good qualities, I can't think of one complaint
That's why you're number one
And others ain't

Baby all I wanna do is hold you


And show you how much I adore you
Want you, need you
Baby, you're ... you're my favorite girl
Baby you're the only one
I wanna give you the world

Yeah, you're ... you're my favorite girl
You really really got it going on
Everything that a man could want
You're my favorite girl

You're everything a man like me could ever want
Give me want I need and nothing that I don't
Girl I promise I'll always have your back
You're all I need

You're ... you're my favorite girl
Baby you're the only one
I wanna give you the world

Yeah, you're ... you're my favorite girl
You really really got it going on
Everything that a man could want
You're my favorite girl

You're ... you're my favorite girl
Baby you're the only one
I wanna give you the world

Yeah, you're ... you're my favorite girl
You really really got it going on
Everything that a man could want
You're my favorite girl
