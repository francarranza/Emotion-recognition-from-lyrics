Thank you for the Lamb

Even when I broke, broke your heart
My sins tore us apart
But I'm standin' right here in the midst of my tears
I claim you to be the lamb of God
New life can begin, yeah
For you washed away, washed away everyone of my sins
Whom the Son sets free is truly free indeed
I claim you to be the lamb of God

Born into sin that I may live again
