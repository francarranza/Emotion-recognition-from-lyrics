Ah, many days it goes unspoken
But this desire never seems to go away
It's gonna take much more than hope to bring
You close
I think I'll pray

I hear you say you've got got a lot to give up
And there is so much more this heart of mine
Can take
If what you have to bring to me is positive you send
It right away
Right away

I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
I want a love that's sure to stand the test of time
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
Morning, noon and night, forever all mylife
Good love, good love
Good love, good love

There is a void that stands between us
And it seems it's getting harder to relate
Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine
Life this way

I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
I want a love that's sure to stand the test of time
I want to know what good love feels like
Good love, good love
Hear me when I say, bring it to me baby

Babe, you're the man I hear you say you are
I don't quite understand why loving me
Is so hard
Never have I felt the need to be this close
Words cannot say, heaven only knows

Repeat Chorus 1 and fade
