This is a forecast of a storm
For some it seems that this storm won't pass
For you it seems so dark
That day will never ever come into your life
Sunny and bright

So when the rain falls down on me
Lord take me high up so I can see
The rainbow, the rainbow
Though the rain cause many complications
Lord I'm still looking for your decoration
Called the rainbow
I wanna see your rainbow
The rainbow tells me this storm has passed
The rainbow tells me this storm has passed

My god his word it just won't fail
And his glory it will prevail
Just like the rainbow in the sky
It's so powerful and it's so bright
The rainbow, I wanna see the rainbow

Vamp
He'll take your winter
Turn it to spring
Summer will fall
Fall into place

The storm has passed, the storm
This storm has passed

The rainbow tells me this storm has passed
