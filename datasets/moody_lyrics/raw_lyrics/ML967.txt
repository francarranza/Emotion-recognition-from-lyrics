In this world of ordinary people, extraordinary people
I'm glad there is you
In this world of overrated pleasures, of underrated treasures
I'm so glad there is you

I live to love, I'll love to live with you beside me
This role so new I'll muddle through with you to guide me

In this world where very many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you
More than ever I'm glad there is you

I live to love, I'll love to live with you beside me
This role so new I'll muddle through with you to guide me

In this world where very many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you
More than ever I'm glad there is you
