If you want to hang out
You've got to take her out, cocaine
If you want to get down
Down on the ground, cocaine

She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie, cocaine

If you got bad news
You want to kick them blues, cocaine
When your day is done
And you got to run, cocaine

She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie, cocaine

If your thing is gone
And you want to ride on, cocaine
Don't forget this fact
You can't get it back, cocaine

She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie, cocaine

She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie, cocaine
