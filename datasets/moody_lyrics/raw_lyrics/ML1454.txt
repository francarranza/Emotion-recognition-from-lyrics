Money, can't make you turn your head now
Money, can't get you into bed now
Money, honey - can't give more than you get now

Money, honey - you ain't got no respect
Snide like a fox, yeah, just to see what you can get
And money honey get your breakfast in bed
Hey money honey, oh you drive me out of my head

Living - like a princess with a frown
Giving - I can't afford a crown
Money - honey - hey girl come on don't bring me down

Money, honey - you ain't got no respect
Snide like a fox, yeah, just to see what you can get
And money honey get your breakfast in bed
Hey money honey, oh you drive me out of my head

Money - must it buy all I get now
Money - without how far would I get now
Money, money, money, money - honey
Without it you'd be losing my respect now
