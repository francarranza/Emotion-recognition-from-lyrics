I want to tease you, I want to please you
I want to show you, baby, that I need you
I want your body, till the very last drop
I want you to holler, when you want me to stop

And who can love you like me ()
Who can sex you like me ()
Who can treat you like me now, baby ()
Nobody, baby ()
And who can do it like me ()
And who can give you what you need ()
Who can do you all night long ()
Nobody, baby ()

:
I want the night, for me and you
So come here baby, and let me do it to you
Don't be afraid, 'cause I won't bite
I promise to give it to you just the way you like

And who can love you like me ()
Who can sex you like me ()
Who can lay your body down ()
Nobody, baby ()
And who can treat you like me ()
Who can give you what you need ()
And who can do you all night long ()
Nobody, baby ()

And the band keeps playing on

:
O-o-on and o-on
O-o-on and o-on
O-o-on and o-on
Nobody, baby

O-o-on and o-on
O-o-on and o-on
O-o-on and o-on
Nobody, baby

:
I want you, right now for my lover ()
Place no one above you ()
If you need love, I'll be right there, baby
I'll be right there, baby ()
Oh yes I will baby
Oh yes I will baby

And who will love you like me ()
Who can sex your body like me baby ()
Who can do it like me, baby ()
No, no, no, no, no ()

Who can lay you down just like me ()
Who can kiss you all over your body, baby ()
