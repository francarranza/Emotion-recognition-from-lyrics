I felt it first when I was younger
A strange connection to the light
I try to satisfy the hunger
I never got it right, I never got it
So I climbed a mountain and built an altar
Looked out as far as I can see
And everyday I'm getting older
I'm running out of dreams, I'm running out of dreams

But your love, your love
The only thing that matters is your love, your love
Is all I have to give
Your love is enough to light up the darkness
It's your love, your love
All I ever needed is your love

You know the effort I have given
And you know exactly what it cost
And though my innocence was taken
Not everything is lost, not everything is lost, no

But your love, your love
The only thing that matters is your love, your love
Is all I have to give
Your love is enough to light up the darkness
It's your love, your love
All I ever needed is your love

You're the hope in the morning
You're the light when the night is falling
You're the song when my heart is singing
It's your love
You're the eyes to the blind man
You're the feet for the lame man walking
You're the sound of the people singing
It's your love (your love, your love)

But your love, your love
The only thing that matters is your love, your love
Is all I have to give
Your love is enough to light up the darkness
It's your love, your love
All I ever needed is your love

All I ever needed is your love, your love
All I never needed is your love
It's all I ever needed
