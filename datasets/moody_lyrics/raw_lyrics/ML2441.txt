Your fear, your flesh
Cruel horror, your fate

Cursed shroud, your void
Dust to dust, you're feel harm

In your eyes we shall fall
Torture of death

Punishes to life shame of chaos
Awaking them its bound of chaos

Locked in pain your flesh
Tearing horror of pain

We arise, rise in tomb
To terror in your eyes
