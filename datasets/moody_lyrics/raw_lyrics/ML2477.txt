We have all the time in the world
Time enough for life to unfold all the precious things life has in store
And we got all the love in the world
And as time goes by, you will find we need nothing more

And every step of the way we'll find us
With the kiss of the world behind us
And we got all the time in the world for love
Nothing more, nothing less, only love
(2x)

Only love, yeah baby
