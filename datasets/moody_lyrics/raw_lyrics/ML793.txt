My girl's like candy, a candy treat
She knocks me right up off my feet
She's so fine as can be
I know this girl was meant for me

Candy girl
You are my world
Look so sweet
You're a special treat
Candy girl
All I want to say
When you're with me
You brighten up my day

All I know when I'm with you
You make me feel so good
Through and through
The way you walk
And the way you talk
You always look so good 
You make me forget my thoughts

Do you really love me?
Don't you really care?
Do you really need me?
And will you always be there?

Every night and every day
I'm always thinking of you in every way
All I know is when I'm with you
You make me feel so good
Through and through

Candy girl
You are my world
You're everything, everything.
Everything to me
Candy girl
All I want to say
I need your love
Each and everyday

Hey fellas!

Check out Mike and Bobby's little lady!
(Whoo-wee!)
Well, check out Ricky and Ralph's
(Whoo-wee!)
What about Ronnie's?
She's bad
She's bad
I know she's bad

She walks so fast she looks so sweet
She makes my heart just skip a beat

My girl's the best and that's no lie
She tells me that I'm her only guy

That might be true but my girl's a joy
She don't play around, she's right to the point

My girl's like candy, a candy treat
She knocks me hot up off my feat

Ah, candy
You look so sweet
Ah, candy
You're a special treat

Candy
(You're my candy)
Candy girl

Candy
(You're my candy)
Candy girl

All I want to say
You're everything, everything
Everything to me

Candy girl
You are my world
