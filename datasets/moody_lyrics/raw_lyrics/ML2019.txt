Some people they call me crazy
For falling in love with you
They can take me and lock me away baby
'Cause there's nothing those bars can do

I'll be the rising moon after setting sun
Just to let you know you'll always have someone
I'll be the clearest day when the rain is done
So you'll always know

Through the shake of an earthquake
I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like a ship through the storm
We can risk it all
That's how strong my love is

I use to feel kinda lonely
Cause the world it can be so fake
All that matters I'm telling you
Is you and me only
And the fortress from love we make

I'll be the water you need in the desert land
Just to let you know you'll always have my hand
I'll be the woman you need to be a better man
So you'll always know

Through the shake of an earthquake

I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like a ship through the storm
We can risk it all
That's how strong my love is

Oh, can't nothing break us down
Oh, 'cause we are heaven bound
Like the mountain standing tall:
Immovable; we're here to stay
Oh, can't nothing get in the way

Through the shake of an earthquake
I will never fall (I will never fall)
That's how strong my love is (that's how strong my love is)
Like a ship through the storm
We can risk it all (we can risk it all)
That's how strong my love is (that love is)

Through the deepest waters
I won't let you drown (I won't let you drown Oh!)
That's how strong my love is (Oh that's how strong my love, my love, my love)
'Cause we're the moon in the sky
That will never come down (never come down)
That's how strong my love is (Oh that's how strong my love is)
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
