Grab your gun, time to go to hell
I'm no hero, guilty as charged
Search and destroy

Found my faith, living in sin
I'm no Jesus, but neither are you my friend
I'm a whore, a birth of broken dreams
This simple answer is never what it seems

A million little pieces we've broken into
A million little pieces I've stolen from you

Search and destroy
Search and destroy
(Woah oh oh woah)
Search and destroy
Search and destroy

Sold my soul to Heaven and to Hell
Sick as my secrets, but never gonna tell
I'm to blame, burden of my dreams
A curse of faith and a blessing I believe, I believe, I believe

I believe
Oh, I believe (a million little pieces)
I believe

Search and destroy
Search and destroy
(Woah oh oh woah)
Search and destroy
Search and destroy
Search and destroy

Let go, let go
Let me go, let me go
Let go, let go
Let me go

Search and destroy
A million little pieces
A million little pieces
A million little pieces
A million little pieces
(Search and destroy)
A million little pieces
A million little pieces
A million little pieces
Stolen from you

Woah oh oh woah
Woah oh oh woah
Woah oh oh woah
Woah oh oh woah

Search and destroy (Woah oh oh woah)
Search and destroy (Woah oh oh woah)
Search and destroy (Woah oh oh woah)
Search and destroy (Woah oh oh woah)

A million little pieces
A million little pieces to start
