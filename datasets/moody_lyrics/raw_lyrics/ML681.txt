Mom and dad went to a show
They dropped me off at Grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed, said please don't go

Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home

I had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatoes and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good

Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home

She said, well, don't you start your crying
Go outside and ride your bike
That's what I did, I killed my toe

Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home

After dinner, I had ice cream
I fell asleep and watched TV
I woke up in my mother's arms

Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
I wanna be alone
