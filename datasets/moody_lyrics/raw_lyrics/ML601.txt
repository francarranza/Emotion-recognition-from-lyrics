You can climb a mountain
You can swim the sea
You can jump into the fire
But you'll never be free

You can shake me up
Or I can break you down
Whoa-o-o-o-, whoa-o-o-o-

We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy

We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy

We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy

We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy

You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
