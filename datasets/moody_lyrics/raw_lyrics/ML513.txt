You're my thrill 
You do something to me 
You send chills right through me 
When I look at you 
'Cause you're my thrill 

You're my thrill 
How my pulse increases 
I just go to pieces 
When I look at you 
'Cause you're my thrill 

Nothing seems to matter 
Here's my heart on a silver platter 
Where's my will 
Why this strange desire 
That keeps mounting higher 
When I look at you 
I can't keep still 

You, my thrill 
You know you are my thrill 

Nothing seems to matter 
Here's my heart on a silver platter 
Where's my will 
Why this strange desire 
That keeps mounting higher 
When I look at you 
I can't keep still 

You, my thrill 
You know you are my thrill
