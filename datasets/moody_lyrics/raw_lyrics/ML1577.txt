Listen Baby
I can't get you off of my mind
Ooh precious darlin'
It's just a matter of time
Before we get together
And I promise you
I'll make right
There'll be no doubt baby
Please try and understand
I want to be your man
Oh Listen Baby
Oh Listen Darlin'

My Sweet Baby
Seems no matter what I do
Mowin' the lawn gasin' my car
I'm still thinking of you
Girl it's a mystery
One that won't let me be
I got it bad
And it's a good thing honey
Please try and understand
I want to be your man
Oh Listen Baby
Listen darlin'


As I hear the tick, took of the clock upon the wall
I know that times moving on, that's my wakeup call
It's time to make some decisions, and I know that it's
You that I want
No more hesitation baby, No more being nonchalant
My old life is through and with this
Ring I promise you - I'm yours.
