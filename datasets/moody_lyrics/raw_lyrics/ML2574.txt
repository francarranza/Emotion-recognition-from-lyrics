Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said, "Baby, can't you see?
I wanna be famous, a star on the screen 
But you can do something in between

Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car and baby I love you, yes I do baby

I told that girl that my prospects were good
She said, "Baby, it's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine but I can show you a better time

Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car and baby I love you

Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car and baby I love you
I told that girl I could start right away
And she said, "Listen babe, I've got something to say
I got no car and it's breaking my heart
But I've got a driver and that's a start"

Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car and baby I love you
