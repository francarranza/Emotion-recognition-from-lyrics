I got a rip in my pants and a hole in my brand new shoes
I got a Margarita nose and a breath full of Mad Dog Booze

I got the fever, fever, fever, fever

Yeah, they threw me outa jail I tell ya it ain't fair
I tried to kiss the judge from the electrica' chair
Yeah we're all here 'cause we're not all there tonight

The guitar's cranked and the bass man's blown a fuse
And when the whole gang bangs tell me then what's you're excuse

We got the fever, fever, fever, fever

Fever gives ya lust with an appetite
It hits ya like the fangs from a rattlesnake bite
We're all here 'cause we're not all there tonight

We can't run away from trouble
There ain't no place that far
But if we do it right at the speed of light
There's the back seat of my car, caviar

I was feelin' so high I forgot what day
Now I'm feelin' low down even slow seems way too fast
And now the booze don't work and the drugs ran out of gas

I got the fever, fever, fever, fever

The buzz that you be gettin' from the crack don't last
I'd rather be O.D.in' on the crack of her ass
Yeah we're all here 'cause we're not all there tonight

My first time ever lover
We fell asleep out on the lawn
And when I woke up I was all alone
Makin' love to the crack of dawn
So yo, I beg yo pardon sir
The gangster of love rides again

I got the fever
You know I gotta chill
Fever
It gimme such a thrill
Fever
Like a burnin' plague
Fever
Yeah get outta my way

Fever may be Hell and a cross to bear
As long as I'm in heaven honey I don't care
You look so good baby look so fine
I tell you you're the image of the perfect crime
You gets so tired holdin' on so tight
If you think you're goin' crazy well you may be right
Yeah, we're all here 'cause we're not all there, that's right
