Well look who's comin' through the door
I think we've met somewhere before hello love hello love
Where in the world have you been so long
I've missed you so since you've been gone hello love hello love
Make yourself feel right at home
I hope you plan on staying long come in love come in love
I must say I was sure surprised
You're the last thing I expected by hello love hello love
I've heard it said time and again you often go back where you've been
I really didn't believe it was true but I left the door unlocked for you

I'll try to please you in every way
Assure you of a pleasant stay this time love this time love
I've been so blue since you've been gone
Now you're back with me and nothing's wrong hello love hello love
(Ac.guitar)
I've heard it said...
And it's wonderful now you're back with me
And things are like they used to be remember love remember love
You're back with me now and my world's complete
So don't mind me if I repeat hello love hello love hello love hello love
