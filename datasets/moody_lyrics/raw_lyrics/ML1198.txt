It's the same old song
You've got to be somewhere at sometime
And they never let you fly
It's like broken glass
You get cut before you see it
So open up your eyes

You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Stand up and shout, shout
Stand up and shout

You've got wings of steel
But they never really move you
You only seem to crawl
You've been nailed to the wheel
But never really turning
You know you've got to want it all

You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Stand up and shout, shout
Stand up and shout
Let it out

You are the strongest chain
And you're not just some reflection
So never hide again

You are the driver
You own the road
You are the fire
Go on, explode

You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Stand up and shout
Stand up and shout
Let it out
Stand up and shout
