Have you listed all the times you've tried 
Do you call on all your alibis 
When somebody asks the question why are you hiding 

Did you feel the pull, did you hear a call 
Did you take a chance and lose it all 
Do you fear there's no collateral left for trying 

Friend I know your heart is raw 
But love is still a worthy cause 
Picking up and pressing on 
Oh love is still a worthy cause 
It's the touch that starts the thaw 
Love is still a worthy cause 
Or the word that breaks the pause 
Love 

It's the beauty in the tales we tell 
It's the pushing through and ending well 
And finding strength to give ourselves away 

In the midst of passing bravery 
In the face of our own injury 
It's the constant generosity of grace 

Friend I know your heart is raw 
But love is still a worthy cause 
Picking up and pressing on 
Oh love is still a worthy cause 
It's the touch that starts the thaw 
Love is still a worthy cause 
Or the word that breaks the pause 
Love 

I love because he loved me 
When I had nothing 
I love because he loved me 
When I had nothing 
I love because he loved me 
When I had nothing
