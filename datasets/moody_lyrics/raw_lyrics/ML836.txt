I have felt it
And I have held it
I have known
A woman's love 
I have tasted
And I have wasted
A woman's love
And I know
I'll never understand 
All the little things
That make It grand 
A woman's love
And I know
I'll never come Face to face 
With any thing
That takes the Place 
Of a woman's love

Well I have kiss it
Tried to resist it 
I have missed
A woman's love
And I have hated
Taken for granted
A woman's love

Well I have needed
And I have pleaded 
And I have lost
A woman's love 

And I have worshipped
And I have cursed it
A woman's love
Well I adore it
Thank god for it
A woman's love
