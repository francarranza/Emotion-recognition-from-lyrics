Please, please baby, baby come back home
I's so cold and dark here all alone
If you come back I promise I'll be good
If you come home, baby, I'll act like I should

I laughed when you packed your bags and told me goodbye
I hollered "I don't need you", oh, but honey that's a lie

Please, please baby, baby come back home
It's so cold and dark here all alone
If you come back, I promise I'll be good
If you come home, baby, I'll act like I should

If you don't come home dear, I know I'll go insane
Sweetheart, I plead guilty, darlin' I take all the blame

Please, please baby, baby come back home
It's so cold and dark here all alone
If you come back, I promise I'll be good
If you come home, baby, I'll act like I should

Please, please, please baby, come back home
It's so cold and dark here all alone
If you come back, I promise I'll be good
If you come home, baby, I'll act like I should
If you come home, baby, I'll act like I should
