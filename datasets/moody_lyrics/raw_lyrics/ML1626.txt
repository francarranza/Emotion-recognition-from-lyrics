Being scared is
What keeps you alive
As there is nothing left
After the chance to die

'Cause your every breath
Is scared to death
'Cause your every breath
Is scared to death

'Cause your every breath
Is scared to death
'Cause your every breath
Is scared to death
'Cause your every breath
Is scared to death
