They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tint so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by, they can see the glean
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen

Ride with a new chick, she like “hold up”
Next to the PlayStation controller
Is a full clip in my pistola
Turn a jacker into a coma

Girl, you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryin' to bone ain't tryin' to have no babies
Ride clean as hell, so I pull in ladies
Laws on patrol and you know they hate me

Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some niggas try to jack for some
But we packin' somethin' that we have for 'em
Will have a nigga locked up in the maximum

Security cell, I'm grippin' oak
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow
Twin's steady twistin' like “Hit this dough”
Police pull up right behind and is in his throat

Windows down, gotta stop pollution
CD changes, niggas like, “Who is that producin'?”
This the Play N Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston
But I still ain't losin'

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

My music's so loud ,I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

I been drinkin' and smokin'
Holdin' shit cause a brother can't focus
I gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope
This big ol' Excursion swervin' all up in the curve

A nigga been sippin' on that Hennessey
And the gin again, it's in again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I puff on a blunt
And rollin' another one up, we livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck

I got a blunt up my right hand
40 oz. in my lap freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dawgs

Yo, I gotta get back to backstreets
Wonderin' about the six pounds and I got heat
Glock-Glock, shots to the block, we creep-creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me on the low key

With no regard for the law, we dodge 'em like “fuck 'em all”
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car and a blunt to spark
But well if you want, nigga, you poppin' dark
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air
Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

Now do what you think it so, I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slower
And they upset for sho cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro

So they get behind me tryin' to check my tags
Look at my rearview and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong, well keep tryin'
Steady denyin' that it's racial profilin'

Houston, Texas, you can check my tags
Pull me over try to check my slab
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast

And bein' the baller that I am, I talk to them
Givin' a damn about not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood

I'ma laugh at you, and then I'm a have to cruise
Yeah, my number two on some old DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This a message to the laws, tellin' them “We hate you”

I can't be touched or tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone tryin' to find a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me, I'm 'bout to pull up at your home
And it's on

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
