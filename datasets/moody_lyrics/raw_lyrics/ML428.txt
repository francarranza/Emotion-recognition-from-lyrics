I'll always love you
For the rest of my days
You have won my heart and my soul
With your sweet, sexy ways
You gave me hope
When I needed someone near
You bring me happiness
Everyday of every year
And I'll always love you
For all that you are
You have made my life complete
You're my lucky star
You are the one
That I'd been searching for
You are my everything
Tell me who could ask for more
And I'll always love you
Honey, this will never end
I need you by my side, baby
You're my lover, my friend
Oh, my friend
You gave my world
A thrill I've never known
And filled my eager heart
With a love to call my own
And I'll always love you
You must know how much I do
You can count on me forever
And I will take good care of you
I'll always love you
I'm so happy that you're mine
I always love you
Till the end of time
