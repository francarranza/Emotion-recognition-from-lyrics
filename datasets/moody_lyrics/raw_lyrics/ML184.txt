I've got got the joy of the lord, living inside of me
My soul rejoices, when my problems start knocking at me.
Full of glory, joy unspeakable I got the joy of the lord.
I've got the joy of the lord on the inside of me

I've got the joy of the lord
Living inside of me.
My soul rejoices when my problems come knocking at me.
It's full of glory, hoy unspeakable.
I've got the joy of the lord
I've got the joy
I've got the joy of the lord on the inside of me

I've got the joy of the lord

When I've been crying all night long.
It wipes the tears away.
Lifts my head and say we've been made in due for a night.
Joy!

Is coming, is coming in the morning time.
I've got the joy of the lord,
I've got the joy of the lord on the inside of me.
I've got the joy of the lord, when I've been crying all night long,
Wipes the tears away,
Lifts my head and says we've been made in due for night but joy is coming,
Is coming in the morning time I've got the joy of the lord,
I've got the joy of the lord on the inside of me.

I've got joy
Joy

Joy

Joy

Joy

Joy

Joy
Joy

(Repeat: x3)
The world didn't give it, the world can't take it away
