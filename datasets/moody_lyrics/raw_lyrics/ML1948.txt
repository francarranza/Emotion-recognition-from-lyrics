Baby you take me away

Sweet emotion
Sweet devotion
Baby you take me away
Kiss me softly
Love me slowly
It's (heavenly)
Like the sunrise
Tender love eyes
Baby I need you stay
It's so (heavenly)

Whoa
You're my loved one
Sent just for me
Whoa
You're my angel
So heavenly
Whoa
Reign your love down
Reign down on me
Ooh
Baby the love you give is so heavenly

Heavenly eyes see into my soul
And for you
I would climb any mountain
And baby
You know me
More than anyone else
Beside this gift that we're sharing
No other one can compare it
You touch me
And take me to heaven

Whoa
You're my loved one
Sent just for me
Whoa
You're my angel
So heavenly
Whoa
Reign your love down
Reign down on me
Ooh
Baby the love you give is so heavenly

Heavenly nights and mornings are passing
Crazy in love ever lasting
And all that you worries
All I'm ever asking
For life I will always love you
You are the one I belong to
And my heart is no heart without you

Whoa
You're my loved one
Sent just for me
Whoa
You're my angel
So heavenly
Whoa
Reign your love down
Reign down on me
Ooh
Baby the love you give is so heavenly

I found heaven, heaven, heaven on earth
And I never, never desert you
Promise I'll stay true
(Oh oh)
I found heaven, heaven, heaven in life
And I've seen it, seen it with my own eyes
It's real, so real, so real

Whoa
You're my loved one
Sent just for me
Whoa
You're my angel
So heavenly
Whoa
Reign your love down
Reign down on me
Ooh
Baby the love you give is so heavenly
