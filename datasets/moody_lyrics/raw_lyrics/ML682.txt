After all of the times that we've tried
I found out we were living a lie
And after all of this love that we made
I found out you don't love me the same

The way that I love
The way that I love you
The way that I love
The way that I love you
The way that I love
The way that I love you

I woke up kinda early today
And something told me from that moment
It wouldn't be the same
It felt like you were hiding something
But I didn't push it
I didn't complain or say nothin'
I triedacted like I didn't see it
Cause deep down I knew I didn't want to believe it

But there it was, it was you and her
You left your sidekick on the nightstand
And I read

Everything you did, and everything you said and
And now I'm standing here looking like damn...
I thought it was you and I
Now I all I got to say is why?

After all of the time that we've tried
I found out we were living a lie
And after all of this love that we made
I know now you don't love me the same

The way that I love
The way that I love you
The way that I love
The way that I love you
The way that I love
The way that I love you

I notice now, that when I am around
You be trying to lock the door

Whispering on the phone
Now wait a minute since we been in this house
You ain't never did this before
Tell me what's this about?

I tried to sit and say to myself
This here is too good he don't want nothing else
But there it was, it was you and her
You left your credit card receipt inside the beamer babe

Everything you bought her, and everything you spending
Now I'm standing here once again
I thought it was you and I
Now I all I have to say is why?

After all of the times that we've tried
I found out we were living a lie
And after all of this love that we made
I know now you don't love me the same

The way that I love
The way that I love you
The way that I love
The way that I love you
The way that I love
The way that I love you

You Lied, You lied, Oh Why?
Why'd you have to lie to me?
Why'd you have to lie to me?
Why'd you have to lie to me?
Why?

After all of the times that we've tried
I found out we were living a lie
And after all of this love that we made
I know now you don't love me the same

The way that I love
The way that I love you
The way that I love
The way that I love you
The way that I love
The way that I love you
