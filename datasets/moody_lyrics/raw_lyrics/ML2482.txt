The kids are digging up a brand new hole
Where they put their deadbeat mom
Grandpa's happy watching video porn
With the closed caption on

And father knows best
About suicide and smack
Well, he-he-he

Cancer for the cure
Cancer for the cure
Buckle up and endure now, baby
Cancer for the
Cure

Old blue eyes is back again
But he was never here in the first place
A heart attack may be something to fear
But take a look out back

'Cause Courtney needs love
And so do I
Well, he-he-he-he

Cancer for the cure
Cancer for the cure, my baby
Buckle up and endure now, sweet thing
Cancer for the cure

Cancer for the cure
Cancer for the cure, my baby
Buckle up and endure now, sweet thing
The cancer for the
The cancer for the
The cancer for the
The cancer for the cure
(Cancer for the cure)
(Cancer for the cure)
(Cancer for the cure)
(Cancer for the cure)

(He-he-he)

(Cancer for the cure)
(Cancer for the cure)
(Cancer for the cure)
(Cancer for the cure)
