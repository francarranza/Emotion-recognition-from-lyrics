Oh no. You drive me crazy. You do!

Don't you know, know, know
What you're doin' to me
Only you drive me wild
You're my ecstasy

Can't you tell
By the look in my eyes
That I love you
I've gotta show ya
What I feel in my heart
'Cause I knew it
Right from the start

That I'm mad about you
I go crazy with
All of the things that you do
I'm mad about you
I'm so angry inside
And it's all over you
I'm mad about you

Don't ya go, go, go
Too f-far away
I need you close by my side
Always here to stay

Can't you tell
By the look in my eyes
That I love you
I've gotta show ya
What I feel in my heart
'Cause I knew it
Right from the start

That I'm mad about you
I go crazy with
All of the things that you do
I'm mad about you
I'm so angry inside
And it's all over you
I'm mad about you

It's been a long time baby
'Ooh I keep this brewin' inside
I can't take anymore
Oh girl, I'm mad about you

I'm mad about you
Can't you tell
When I look in your eyes
I'm mad about you

That I'm mad about you
I go crazy with
All of the things that you do
I'm mad about you
I'm so angry inside
And it's all over you
I'm mad about you
