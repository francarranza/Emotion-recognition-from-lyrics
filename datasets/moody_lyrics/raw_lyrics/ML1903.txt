I cannot tell you you're falling apart
Open your eyes if you wanna survive
I want to tell you your love is a lie
But I won't tell you, I won't tell you

I can't leave this, I am fine inside it
I don't feel bliss and I just keep hiding
I've been burnt so bad but I still play with fire
Sometimes naked truth is what I don't believe in

I cannot tell you you're falling apart
Open your eyes if you wanna survive
I want to tell you your love is a lie
But I won't tell you, I won't tell you
I cannot get so deep into this now
I can't admit that I know what I know and
I want to tell you your love is a lie
I won't tell you, I won't tell you

It's hard to hear through the static again
It's never clear until the rush of pain
I'll never tell you I'm living a lie
In this confusion I feel alive
I've been burnt so bad but I still play with fire
Sometimes naked truth is what I can't believe in

I cannot tell you you're falling apart
Open your eyes if you wanna survive
I want to tell you your love is a lie
But I won't tell you, I won't tell you
I cannot get so deep into this now
I can't admit that I know what I know and
I want to tell you your love is a lie
I won't tell you, I won't tell you

Don't ever tell me I'm falling apart
Don't ever tell me I will not survive
Don't ever tell me this love is a lie
'Cause I'm the lie
I'm the liar

I cannot tell you you're falling apart
Open your eyes if you wanna survive
I want to tell you your love is a lie
But I won't tell you, I won't tell you
I cannot get so deep into this now
I can't admit that I know what I know and
I want to tell you your love is a lie
I won't tell you, I won't tell you
I won't tell you
