Window Seat 30,000 Feet Above The Ground
Blue Moon Beams On Silver Wings Bring Me Down
Slipping Off my coat for the long night flight
I find a note she wrote last night
I can almost hear those words as I close my eyes

Goodnight Sweetheart sleep tight, wherever you are
God hold you in his arms while we're apart
Tho your far away your love will stay tucked away here in my heart
Goodnight Sweetheart sleep tight wherever you are

These days I leave, the one who needs me more and more it seems
It's a high price that she pays for the dreams I dream

So Goodnight Sweetheart sleep tight, wherever you are
God hold you in his arms while we're apart
Tho your far away your love will stay tucked away herre in my heart
Goodnight Sweetheart sleep tight wherever you are
