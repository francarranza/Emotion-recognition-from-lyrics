Just off of the beaten path
A little dot on the state road map
That's where I was born and where I'll die

Things move at a slower pace
Nobody's in a rat race
And these days that's a special way of life

Down Home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down Home
A man's good word and a hand shake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times they can fall back home
Those of us raised up down home

In the corner of the hardware store
Gathered round on a checkered board
Old men telling lies and crownin' kings

Kids drivin' round the old town square
Cops roll down int he cool night air
Go and see what's shakin' at the Dairy Queen

Down Home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down Home
A man's good word and a hand shake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times they can fall back home
Those of us raised up down home

When I was a boy I couldn't wait to leave this place
But now I wanna see my children raised

Down Home

Down Home

Folks know
If there fallin' on hard times they can fall back home
Those of us raised up
Down Home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down Home
A man's good word and a handshake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times they can fall back home
Those of us raised up
Down Home

Down Home
Way down home
Down home
Down Home
Way down home
