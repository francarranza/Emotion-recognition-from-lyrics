Slide on over baby
Underneath this mistletoe
Here's a toast to us together
Let me wrap you in this bow.

I'll mend Christmas spirits
This one won't be blue
It's gonna be the best one ever
And it's all because of you, baby.

You're the angel at the top of my tree
Best present anybody ever gave me
I got it decorated on and the gift's underneath
You're the angel at the top of my tree.

Let's put on that old movie
It's a wonderful night
'Cause curled up by the fire
It sure is true tonight.

Let's make a little candle
And the a little later on
We'll make a little love
To that old Bill Cosby song, baby.

You're the angel at the top of my tree
Best present anybody ever gave me
I got it decorated on and the gift's underneath
You're the angel at the top of my tree.

You're the angel at the top of my tree
Best present anybody ever gave me
I got it decorated on and the gift's underneath
You're the angel at the top of my tree.

Baby you're the angel...
