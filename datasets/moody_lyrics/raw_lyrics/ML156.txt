She calls me up and says, "Baby it's a lonely ol' night.
I don't know I'm just so scared and lonely all at the same time."
Nobody told us it was gonna work out this way, no, no, no, no, no
I guess they knew we'd work it out in our own way

It's a lonely ol' night
Can I put my arms around you?
It's a lonely ol' night
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you

Radio playing softly some singer's sad, sad song
He's singing about standing in the shadows of love
I guess he feels awfully alone
She says, I know exactly what he means
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And it's a sad, sad, sad, sad feeling
When you're living on those in-betweens
But it's okay

It's a lonely ol' night
Can I put my arms around you?
It's a lonely ol' night
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you

She calls me Baby
She calls everybody Baby
It's a lonely ol' night, but ain't they all

It's a lonely ol' night
Can I put my arms around you?
It's a lonely ol' night
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you

It's a lonely ol' night
Can I put my arms around you
It's a lonely ol' night
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you

Yeah, like me and you
Yeah, like me and you
