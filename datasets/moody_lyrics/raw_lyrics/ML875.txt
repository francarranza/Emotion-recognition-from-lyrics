Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my babe
I want to tell you how much I love you

Come with me, my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I want to tell you just how much I love you

Come with me, to the sea of love

Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my babe
I want to tell you oh how much I love you

Come with me, to the sea of love

Come with me, my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I want to tell you just how much I love you

I want to tell you oh how much I love you
