Hello you said the day we met 
Handing me a yellow rose 
You asked me out 
And to your surprise 
And to mine I said I'd go 
I thought it so romantic 
And I found you sweet and bold 
Though we'd only met 
I still said yes 
To a single yellow rose 
And for years to come 
You were the one 
To sleep with me at night 
To laugh and talk 
And share my thoughts 
And hold me when I'd cry 
And on every occasion 
And for no good reason to 
A big bouquet or a single yellow rose 
Was sent from you 

Yellow roses 
The color of sunshine 
You loved me at one time 
Why did you have to go 
Yellow roses 
Are you sending your new love 
My bright yellow rose buds 
I still love you so 

I never see a yellow rose 
That I didn't think of you 
It's still my favorite flower 
Though the yellow's turned to blue 
The day you left my teardrops fell 
Upon your farewell not 
You said goodbye like you said hello 
With a single yellow rose 

Yellow roses 
The color of sunshine 
You loved me at one time 
Why did you have to go 
Yellow roses 
Are you sending your new love 
My bright yellow rose buds 
Oh I still love you so 

Yellow roses 
The color of sunshine 
You loved me at one time 
Why did you have to go 
Sweet yellow roses 
Are you sending your new love 
My bright yellow rose buds 
I still love you so
