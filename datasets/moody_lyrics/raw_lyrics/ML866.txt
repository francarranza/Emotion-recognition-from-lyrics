It ain't the clothes that you wear
It ain't the things that you buy
It ain't your house on the hill
It ain't the plane that you fly

It ain't your black limousine
It ain't your ninety-foot yacht
It ain't the things that you'll get
It ain't the things that you got

It ain't the money or the diamond rings
Honey I ain't impressed with your material things

It's the way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me
It's the way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me

It ain't your friends at the top
It ain't their fortune and fame
It ain't your heavy connections
It ain't the Hollywood game

Ain't famous people or the parties they throw
Honey I ain't impressed with all the people you know

It's just the way that you love me
(In the heat of the night)
It's just the way that you love me
(Baby)
It's just the way that you love me
(When you're loving me right)
It's just the way that you love me
(Baby)
It's just the way that you love me
(And the things that you do)
It's just the way that you love me
(Baby)
It's just the way that you love me
(Make me crazy for you)
It's just the way that you love me

It ain't the money or the diamond rings
Honey I ain't impressed with those material things

It ain't the trips to Brazil
It ain't the weekends in Rome
It ain't the French Riviera
You know I'd rather stay home

Ain't the Bahamas
It ain't Monaco
Honey I ain't impressed
With all the places we go

It's just the way that you love me
The way that you love me
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me
The way that you love me
(It ain't the money)
It's just the way that you love me
(Or the diamond rings)
The way that you love me
(Ain't what you buy me baby)
It's just the way that you love me
(Ain't material things)
The way that you love me
(Ain't your Maserati)
It's just the way that you love me
(Your house on the hill)
The way that you love me
(It ain't the parties)
It's just the way that you love me
(Or the trips to Brazil)
