He done let me down a again
That's odd
Always hurting me
He don't never stop
Must be something wrong with me
I'm lost
'Cause I can't quit letting him
In my heart
How many times am I
Gonna let him apologize
Before I realize
That he ain't worth it, no
How many times he gone light me
Before I blow
This is critical
Here I go

Damn I'm sick and tired
Of how he keep on lying
Damn I'm sick and tired
Of feeling like I'm dying
So, no more complaining
Either put up with it or let it go
Damn I'm sick and tired
Of making up and breaking up
And I'm over being alone
When I wake up
So, no more complaining
Either put up with it or let it go

I should be packing up again
That's odd
And this time I ain't playing
Imma a call it off
I know I shouldn't want revenge
But it's a thought
And maybe if I paid him back
I could move on
How many times am I
Gonna let him tear me down
Let him hang around
He ain't worth it (no)
How many times he
Gone light me before I blow
This is critical


So here I go (aw yeah)

Damn I'm sick and tired
Of how he keep on lying (he be lying)
Damn I'm sick and tired
Of feeling like I'm dying
So, no more complaining (no more)
Either put up with it or let it go (oh)
Damn I'm sick and tired
Of making up and breaking up (Making up, breaking up)
And I'm over being alone
When I wake up (when I wake up)
So, no more complaining (no more, no more)
Either put up with it or let it go (with it or let it go)

Hey
Damn I wish I knew then
What I know now
Damn I wish I never given you
The benefit of the doubt
I can't believe I'm going through this
Boy you got me like whoa
And all the dirty little secrets
Now I know what you're all about
Oh, and ooh ooh baby
I think I done had enough
I think its time that you go away
I just can't take it (oh)
I think I done had enough (oh, yeah yeah)

Damn I'm sick and tired
Of how he keep on lying (I'm so sick and tired, damn)
Damn I'm sick and tired
Of feeling like I'm dying (dying)

Of making up and breaking up (no more)
And I'm over being alone when I wake up (no more, no more)
So, no more complaining
Either put up with it or let it go
No more complaining (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Either put up with it or let it go (yeah)
Either put up with it or let it go
