What have I got to do to make you love me
What have I got to do to make you care
What do I do when lightning strikes me
And I wake to find that you're not there

What do I do to make you want me
What have I got to do to be heard
What do I say when it's all over
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad (so sad), so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad (so sad), so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad (so sad), so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad (so sad), so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

What do I do to make you love me
Oh, what have I got to do to be heard
What do I do when lightning strikes me
What have I got to do
What have I got to do
When sorry seems to be the hardest word
