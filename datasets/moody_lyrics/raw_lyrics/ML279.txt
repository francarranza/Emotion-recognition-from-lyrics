I don't know how to explain it
But I know the words would hardly do
Miracles and signs and wonders
Aren't enough for me to prove to you

Don't you know I've always loved you
Even before there was time
Though you turn away
I tell you still
Don't you know I've always loved you
And I always will

Greater love has not a man
Than the one who gives his life to prove
That he would do anything
And that's what I'm gonna do for you

Don't you know I've always loved you
Even before there was time
Though you turn away
I tell you still
Don't you know I've always loved you
And I always will

Don't you know I've always loved you
Even before there was time
Though you turn away
I tell you still
Don't you know I've always loved you

Don't you know I've always loved you
Even before there was time
Though you turn away
I tell you still
Don't you know I've always loved you
And I always will

I've always loved you
And I always will
I've always loved you
And I always will
I've always loved you
And I always, and I always will
I've always loved you...
