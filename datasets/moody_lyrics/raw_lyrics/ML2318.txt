If you want to know
How far to go
To hell, just ask me.
If you want to see
The view from your knees,
Come down and join me.
I'm the final straw,
The nail in coffin just by being
Who I am, is so goddamn...

I'm not the Master of the Universe,
I walk the earth the wrong way,
Made my pretension and fulfilled the worst,
My past is cursed, the wrong way.

(The wrong way. The wrong way.)

Your glass is half,
His glass is full,
My glass is empty.
You're running short,
Of not enough,
Well I've got plenty.

I've come a long way,
I went the wrong way.

And who I am, is so goddamned

I'm not the Master of the Universe,
I walk the earth the wrong way,
Made my pretension and fulfilled the worst,
My past is cursed, the wrong way.

And when I die I'm gonna fly,
And come and get you.
And when you try and run,
I'll be the curse above you.

It's got to end. It's got to end.

In the race for disaster I will come in first,
That's what I've learned the hard way.

If you want to know
How far to go,
To Hell, just ask me.
If you want to see
The view from your knees,
Come down and join me.

I've come a long way,
I went the wrong way. [x3]
