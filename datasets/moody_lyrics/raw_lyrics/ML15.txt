I love how your eyes close
Whenever you kiss me;
And when I'm away from you,
I love how you miss me.
I love the way you always treat me tenderly
But darling most of all, I love how you love me.

I love how your heart beats,
Whenever I hold you.
I love how you think of me,
Without being told to.
I love the way your touch is always heavenly
But darling most of all, I love how you love me.

I love how your eyes close
Whenever you kiss me
And when I'm away from you
I love how you miss me.
I love the way your touch is always heavenly
But darling most of all, I love how you love me.

I love how you hug me
I love how you squeeze me, tease me, please me
Love how you love me
I love how you love me
