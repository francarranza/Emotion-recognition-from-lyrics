Kill your enemies, my brothers dead around me
Wounds are hurting, death is creeping for me
Smoke is blinding, hearts are pounding, chaos soon ignites
The call is made, it's one for all, will I meet my maker?

 Right now, it's killing time
 Right now, it's killing time
 Right now, it's killing time
 The only way out is to die

God has spoken through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire the death toll grows higher
God has spoken through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire the death toll grows higher

Charge

Fuck this battlefield, the bullets tear around me
Bodies falling, voices calling for me
Limbs are flying, men are crying; such a hurtful sight
The call is made, it's one for all, "Take no prisoners"

 Right now, it's killing time
 Right now, it's killing time
 Right now, it's killing time
 The only way out is to die

God has spoken through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire the death toll grows higher
God has spoken through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire the death toll grows higher

Scream, aim, fire
Scream, aim, fire

 Right now, it's killing time
 Right now, it's killing time
 Right now, it's killing time
 The only way out is to die

God has spoken through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire the death toll grows higher
God has spoken through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire the death toll grows higher

Scream, aim, fire
