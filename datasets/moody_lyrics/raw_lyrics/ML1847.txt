Close your eyes (close your eyes) 
Take a deep breath
Open your heart (open you heart)
And whisper (I love you, I love you, I love you)
Tell me you love me (you love me)
Tell me you love me (you love me) 
You love me (you love me, you love me)

Hold me tight (hold me tight)
Don't say goodnight (don't say goodnight)
We have time (lots of time)
Everything alright (thing's gonna be alright)

Hold me darling (never let me go)
Darling and tell me (and tell me)
You love me (you love me, you love me, you love me)

No, no, no (no, no, no)
Even though (even though)
This is not the way I want it to be
But if you (but if you)
Got to pretend (must pretend)
That's alright with me (Oh oh)

Close your eyes (close your eyes)
Take a deep breath 
Open your heart (open your heart)
And whisper (I love you, I love you, I love you)
Tell me you love me (you love me)
Tell me you love me (you love me) 
You love me (Oh I love you darling with all my heart and soul)
