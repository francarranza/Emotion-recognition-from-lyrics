I see him all the time, every night and every day
I know we're doing fine he calls me, I'm on my way
We never sit around we just go outside instead
He steals my thunder while I pick the flowers in his head

All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time
We go commit a crime, I see him all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time
We go commit a crime, I see him all the time

I see him all the time, every minute, every hour
Our love is like a lime, sometimes sweet but mostly sour
We never fool around, we just walk and talk instead
He steals my thunder while I pick the flowers in his head

All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time
We go commit a crime, we never wait in line
But he always looks so fine, I see him all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, all the time
