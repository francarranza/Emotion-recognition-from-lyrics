Once in a year, it is not thought amiss
To visit our neighbors and sing out like this. 

We wish you a merry Christmas 
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas 
And a happy New Year.
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas 
And a happy New Year.
Good tidings we bring to you and your kin.
We wish you a merry Christmas 
And a happy New Year. 

We all want some figgy pudding
We all want some figgy pudding
We all want some figgy pudding
And a cup of good cheer.
And we won't go until we get some
We won't go until we get some,
We won't go until we get some. 
So bring it right here.
Good tidings we bring to you and your kin.
We wish you a merry Christmas 
And a happy New Year.
A happy New Year. 

Once in a year, it is not thought amiss
To visit our neighbors and sing out like this.
Of friendship and love, good neighbors abound
And peace and goodwill the whole year around. 

(Pace!) (Shanti!) (Salud!) (Shalom!)
The words mean the same, whatever your home.
Why can't we have Christmas the whole year around?
Why can't we have Christmas the whole year around? 

We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas 
And a happy New Year.
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas 
And a happy New Year.
