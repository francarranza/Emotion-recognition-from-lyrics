Sky cracks open, walls falling to the floor
Just as well to keep it a guessing game in store
You're with me now, will be again
All other points in between

And the cruel, cruel mornings
Have turned to days of swim or sink
If living right is easy, what goes wrong

You're causing it to drown
Didn't want to turn that way
You're causing it to drown
Doesn't make a difference now
You're causing it to drown
Silence knows, can't drown a heart

Happenstance is falling through the cracks each day
Too close now to change it, fool's gold is lighter anyway
When in doubt, move on, no need to sort it out
You're with me now, will be again
All other points in between

And I want to find the right side of you
If living right is easy, what goes wrong

You're causing it to drown
Didn't want to turn that way
You're causing it to drown
Doesn't make a difference now
You're causing it to drown
Silence knows, can't drown a heart

When in doubt, move on, no need to sort it out
You're with me now, will be again
All other points in between

And I want to find the right side of you
If living right is easy, what goes wrong

You're causing it to drown
Didn't want to turn that way
You're causing it to drown
Doesn't make a difference now
You're causing it to drown
Silence knows, can't drown a heart
