Would you love me
When nights are cold
Would you love me
When I grow old
Would you care
Baby it's not easy
Take me by surprise
And say you're there

Would you love me
Give me one more chance
Would you love me
Try and understand
Would you share a life
That is music
Show me in your eyes
That you'll stay with me tonight

I'm lost in love
I can't live without you
I'm lost in love,
All my dreams around you
And I'm lost in love
And it's true
I can't live without you
Oh, no

Would you love me
When I'm in doubt
Would you love me
Just to be around
Would you share my
Life that is music
Take me in your arms
And sing my melody

I'm lost in love
I can't live without you
I'm lost in love,
All my dreams around you
And I'm lost in love
And it's true
I can't live without you
Oh, no

And I'm lost in love
Say you really want me
Love is a passion
Just can't hide
And I'm lost in love
Time and again and it
Hurts me

You'll be my reason
For starting again, again

I'm lost in love
I can't live without you
I'm lost in love
And all my dreams around you
I'm lost in love
I can't live without you
I'm lost in love
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm lost in love
Baby I can't live without you
