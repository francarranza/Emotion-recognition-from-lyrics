You're the only thing
I know I can be sure of
Call me crazy
You're the one that I want more of

And when we're walking
There's not a cloud
In the way of my sunny day

I know they're talking
There's not a thing they could say
That could stand in the way of our love
Love of our love, love

Happy just to stay with you
Here in a bubble
Let their words roll off me
When they say that you're just trouble

And I'll keep walking
There's not a doubt in the way
Of our sunny day

They can keep talking
There's not a thing they could say
That could get in the way of this love
Love, of this love, love

'Cause when we're walking
There's not a cloud in the way
Of our sunny day

I'm sure they're talking
There's not a thing they could say
That could stand in the way of our love
Love, love, my love
