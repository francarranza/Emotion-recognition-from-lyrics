If I knew
That you were so sweet, baby
If I figured that out
A long time ago
Maybe, maybe
I woulda spoken to you sooner
Instead
I was moving so slow
So slow 
'Cause I didn't know

If I knew
Loving you would be this sweet, baby
Woulda run to you
With no delay, yes
Now I know
Loving you is so damn sweet, baby
Almost
Made a terrible, terrible
Mistake

Lucky me
You could've easily faded into
Somebody else's love scene
Instead you waited
For me to find
My way
To you

If I knew
Loving you would be this sweet, baby
Woulda run to you
With no delay, yes
Now I know
Loving you is so damn sweet, baby
Almost
Made a terrible, terrible
Mistake

If I knew
Loving you would be this sweet, baby
Woulda run to you
With no delay, yes
Now I know
Loving you is so damn sweet, baby
Almost
Made a terrible, terrible
Mistake

Almost
Made a terrible, terrible
Mistake

Almost
Made a terrible, terrible
Mistake

Almost, almost
Made a terrible, terrible
Mistake

Almost
Made a terrible, terrible
Mistake, mistake

Almost 
Made a terrible, terrible
Mistake, mistake, mistake
