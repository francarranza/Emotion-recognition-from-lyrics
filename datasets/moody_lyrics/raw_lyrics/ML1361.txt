Can't forget the day
That you walked into my Life
It was just the kind of thing
That was so right on time

After all the love changes
My heart had locked the door
Then that girl released her magic
And made me love once more

(Ooohooohoo)

Like the warm rays of the sun
Her sweet love can shine down on me

(Ohohhha)

All at once turned my life around
And with one kiss she set me free

She's giving me Joy, Joy, Joy
That girl she brings me Joy

She's giving me Joy, Joy, Joy
That girl she brings me Joy

Goodbye Loneliness
And so long to my heartache
Now that Joy has taken over
And decided to stay

Her love lifts me up
Like no other love before
With every beat of my heart
I'm Hold... Holding on... heyayyay

Just look what she's done for me
She's erased all the sadness away
I could never repay the deed
'Cause she keeps lovin' me more and more

She's giving me Joy, Joy, Joy
That girl she brings me Joy

She's giving me Joy, Joy, Joy
And she brings me Joy
She's giving me

(Check one, check two
Can't hold back I'm in love with u)

(Check one, check two,
There's nothing in the world
That I would'nt do for you)

That girl she's giving me Joy, Joy, Joy
(I love the way she loves me)
She brings me Joy

She's giving me Joy, Joy, Joy
(A little bit of lovin' darling)

Oh girl... I love the joy she brings me
She brings me joy, She brings me joy
