So unafraid of what's to come
I hit the ground and run
Not sure what's coming next
And never looking back

Hollow nights to empty days
Something has to change
Before it gets too late
And there's no turning back

One by one we fit and then we fall
One by one we fit and then we fall

Lonely
Is this what we've become?
So lonely
Fragile and unloved

Lost inside ourselves
And blindly staring at the sun
So lonely
Is this what we've become?

Line them up, they fall
Something to live for
Not sure who's coming next
But never looking back

Well I want something more
Something to live for
Before it gets too late
And there's no turning back

One by one, we fit and then we fall
One by one, we fit and then we fall

Lonely
Is this what we've become?
So lonely
Fragile and unloved

Lost inside ourselves
And blindly staring at the sun
So lonely
Is this what we've become?

Is this what we've become?
So lonely
Fragile and unloved

Lost inside ourselves
And blindly staring at the sun
So lonely
Is this what we've become?
