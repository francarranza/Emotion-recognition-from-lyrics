I've gone blind but it's all right
'Cause my specs give me perfect sight
And in a second I can see it all
Everything becomes delightful
I'm not afraid of the dark or noise
I'm not daunted by the bark of boys
I'm with the birds flying in blue skies
Feathery free and I'm feeling fine
This city is a golden gate
The kind of gold that I love to hate
How good it gets in the hype and stress
Even though it's all a well-lit mess
Bury, bury, bury, better plant it in the ground
True or false with the lost and found
Hurry, bury me up to my knees
I'll swing my branches better in the breeze

Mental mammoth, I know I have a very bad habit
Of filling up my cup halfway elephantasizing my eyes
Vision still untrained in seeing what I have gained
A simple remedy of walking into trees
Mistaking birds as bees
Mistaking things I see

Bury, bury, better plant it in the ground
True or false with the lost and found
Bury, bury, better plant it in the ground
True or false with the lost and found
Hurry bury me over my head
Level with the living, level with the dead
Bury, bury better plant your feet down
The true and false of your lost and found
