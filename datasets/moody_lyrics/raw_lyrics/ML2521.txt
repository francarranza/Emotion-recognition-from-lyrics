Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say
It's all right

Little darlin'
It's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darlin'
It feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Little darlin'
The smiles returning to their faces
Little darlin'
It seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

Little darlin'
I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darlin'
It seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
It's all right
It's all right
