Every morning when I wake up yawning
I'm still far away
Trucks still rolling through the early morning
To the place we play

Boy you're home, you're dreaming, don't you know
The tour's still far away
Boy you're home, you're dreaming, don't you know
You're having just a break

Dream we're going out on stage, it feels like
Coming home again
Dream we're going out on stage, it feels like
Coming home again
Dream we're going out on stage, it feels like

Year after year out on the road
It's great to be here to see you all
I know, for me it is like
Coming home

Day after day out on the road
There's no place too far we wouldn't go
We go wherever you like
To rock 'n roll

Jump on the seats, put your hands in the air
Give me a shout, let me hear you out there
The wilder you scream for some more rock 'n roll
The higher we go

Year after year out on the road
It's great to be here to rock you all
I know, for me it is like
Coming home
Coming home

I know, for me it is like
Coming home
Coming home

Like coming home 
Coming home
Like coming home
Coming home
Like coming home
Coming home
Like coming home
Coming home
