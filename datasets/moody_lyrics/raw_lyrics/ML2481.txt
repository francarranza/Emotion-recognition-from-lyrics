Well candyman said been here and gone
Well candyman said been here and gone
Candyman said been here and gone
Wish I was in New Orleans sittin' on a candy stand

Well candyman said
Salty dog
Well candyman said salty dog
Well candyman said salty dog
I can't be your salty dog and I won't be your candyman

Run to the corner get the baby some beer
Run to the corner get the baby some beer
Run to the corner get the baby some beer
Wish I was in New Orleans sittin' on a candy stand

Well candyman said been here and gone
Well candyman said been here and gone
Candyman said been here and gone
