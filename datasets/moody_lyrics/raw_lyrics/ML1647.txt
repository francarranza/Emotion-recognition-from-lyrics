Sleep little baby sleep

Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay,
The little Lord Jesus, asleep in the hay.

And I welcome You in my heart
I pray that we will never part
This love You gave me
Is shining for the whole world to see
Shining for the whole world to see

The cattle are lowing, the sweet Baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes.
I love You, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky,
And stay right by my side till morning is nigh.

And I welcome You in my heart
I pray that we will never part
This love that You gave me
Is shining for the whole world to see
Shining for the whole world to see

Hear the words when
Darkness seems everywhere
People hurting
No one seems to care
We need Your love
To shine down on me

Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask You to stay
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care,
And take us to heaven to live with You there.

And I, I welcome You in my heart
I pray that You will never part
This love You gave me
Is shining

For unto us a child is born
Emmanuel
Prince of Peace
Everlasting Father
What a wonderful King
Keep shining so the whole world can see
Emmanuel

Sleep little Jesus, sleep
Sleep little Jesus, sleep
Emmanuel
Sleep little Jesus, sleep
Sleep little Jesus, sleep
