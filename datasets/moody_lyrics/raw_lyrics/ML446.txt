Sugar, ah, honey, honey
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you

Honey, ah, sugar, sugar
You are my candy girl
And you got me wanting you

I just can't believe the loveliness of loving you
(I just can't believe it's true)
I just can't believe the wonder of this feeling, too
(I just can't believe it's true)

Sugar, ah, honey, honey
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you

Oh, honey, ah, sugar, sugar
You are my candy girl
And you got me wanting you

When I kissed you, girl, I knew how sweet a kiss could be
(I know how sweet a kiss could be)
Like the summer sunshine pour you sweetness over me
(Pour your sweetness over me)

Pour a little sugar on it, honey
Pour a little sugar on it, baby
(I'm gonna make your life so sweet) (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pour a little sugar on it, yeah

Pour a little sugar on it, honey
Pour a little sugar on it, baby
(I'm gonna make your life so sweet) (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pour a little sugar on it, yeah

Sugar, ah, honey, honey
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you

Ohohohoho (Honey, honey, sugar, sugar)
Sugar, sugar (Honey, honey, sugar, sugar)
You are my candy girl (Para, papara)
(Paraparara)
