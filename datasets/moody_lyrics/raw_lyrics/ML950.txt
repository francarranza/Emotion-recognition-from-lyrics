Young boy you done me bad I went and did ya wrong 
Young boy you done me bad I went and did ya wrong 
Then I got high Lord I got high and I got a bone to pick with you 

And I'm sure you know its true 

Oh one day when you're looking back 
You were young and man you were sad 
When you're young you get sad 
When you're young you get sad then you get high 

Oh man 
Young gal you done me bad and I went and did ya wrong 
Young gal you done me bad so I went and did ya wrong 
Then I got high 
Lord I got high 

Now you got a bone to pick with me but I wish you'd let me be 
Oh one day when you're looking back 
You were young and man you were sad 
When you're young you get sad 
When you're young you get sad then you get high 

You get high 
Oh the days the rain would fall your way 
Oh the days the rain would fall your way 
Then you be high cause you got sad 
Cause you got sad 

Oh man
