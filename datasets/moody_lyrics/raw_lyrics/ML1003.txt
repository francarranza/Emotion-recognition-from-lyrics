Well come on let's go, let's go, let's go
Little darling
And tell me that you'll never leave me
Come on let's go and do it again

Well now swing me, swing me, all the way
Down there
Come on let's go little darling
Come on let's go again once more

Well now I love you so
And I'll never let you go
Come on Baby so
Oh! Pretty baby I love you so

Well come on let's go, let's go, let's go
Little darling
And tell me we'll always be together
Come on let's go again and do it again

Well now I love you so
And I'll never let you go
Come on Baby so
Oh! Pretty baby I love you so

Well let's go, let's go, let's go little sweetheart
And tell me we'll always dance together
Come on let's go and do it again
