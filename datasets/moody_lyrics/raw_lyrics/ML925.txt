I'm glad this week is over
I need to get away
Go home and throw my clothes on
Come get you right away

Can't wait to see you looking lovely
I hope you're thinking of me
'Cause all I want is time with you
And only nothing more

So in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you

So in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you

So in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you

So in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you

I see you cross the room
Talking to some men
I love your mannerisms, babe
The way you handle them

Oh, I'm so proud to be with you
So attracted to you too
You're so damn good to me
In everything you do

'Cause I am so in love, so in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you

Oh, I'm so in love, so in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you

I'm so in love, so in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you

I'm so in love, so in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you

Listen, I'm so in love with you
That I can't help myself (can't help it)
As long as is me and you
We don't need nothing else

I've got you
Got you
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Oh, make it last forever

I'm so in love, first ting in the morning
When I open my eyes and see you
I feel like a breath of fresh air
I feel like I can fly

So in love with you
So in love with you
That I can get by
So in love with you
So in love with you
(You know that I love you baby)

So in love with you
So in love with you
Any obstacle that comes my way
(You know I'll do anything for you)

So in love with you
So in love with you
Because of your love
So in love with you
So in love with you

I'm so in love
So in love with you
So in love with you
I'll do anything for you

So in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you
I'll do it, I'll do it

Anytime is all right if you want me, baby I'm there
You're so good to me, anytime is all right
Anytime is all right if you want me, baby I'm there
I'll do anything for you
