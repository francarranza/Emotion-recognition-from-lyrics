You hit me just like heroin
I feel you coursing through my veins
I once tried to kick this addiction
I swear I'll never kick again, won't ever again, no

This addiction, can't seem to live without you
This addiction, no going clean
This addiction, I go through withdrawal without you
Sick with this addiction in me

Well, those others were like methadone
I took to get me through the day
Now I'm trying to find my way back home
Staying clean along the way, hold out for the real thing, yeah

This addiction, can't seem to live without you
This addiction, no going clean
This addiction, I go through withdrawal without you
Sick with this addiction in me

This addiction
This addiction
This addiction, I go off the rails without you
Sick with this addiction in me
