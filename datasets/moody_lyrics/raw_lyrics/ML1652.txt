Joy to the world
The Lord is come
Let Earth receive her King
Let every heart
Prepare him room
And heaven, let heaven

Heaven and nature sing

Everybody sing
Joy to the world
The Lord is come
(Let Earth receive her King)
Let every heart
Prepare him room
Let heaven and nature sing
Let heaven and nature sing
Go tell of his glory
Go shout the new story
That the Savior is born
Let heaven, heaven
Heaven and nature sing

Let fields and flocks
Rocks hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Go tell of his glory
Go shout the new story
The Savior is born
Let heaven, heaven
Heaven, heaven
And nature sing
Sing joy to the world
For the Savior reigns
And makes

Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic hosts proclaim
Glory to the King
While the angels sing

Everybody sing joy
Sing joy to the world
All over the world
Sing joy, oh
Sing joy, everybody sing
Joy to the world
