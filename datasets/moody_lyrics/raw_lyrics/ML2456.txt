You are the sun and moon and stars, are you?
And I could never run away from you

You try at working out chaotic things
And why should I believe myself, not you?

It's like the world is going to end so soon
And why should I believe myself?

You, me and everything
Caught in the fire
I can see me drowning
Caught in the fire

You, me and everything
Caught in the fire
I can see me drowning
Caught in the fire
