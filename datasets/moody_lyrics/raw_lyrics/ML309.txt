My friends wonder why I call you all the time, what can I say?
I don't feel the need to give such secrets away
You think maybe I need help, though I know I'm right, all right
I'm just better off not listening to friends' advice

When they insist on knowing my bliss
I tell them this
When they want to know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I tell them why

Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light

I go crazy wondering what there is to really see
Did the night just take up your time, 'cause it means more to me
Sometimes I forget what I'm doing, I don't forget what I want, I want
Regret what I've done, regret you? I couldn't go on

But if you insist on knowing my bliss
I'll tell you this
If you want to know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I'll tell you why

Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light

I really miss you, babe

Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Oh babe, because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Ohh, because your kiss, your kiss is on my list...
