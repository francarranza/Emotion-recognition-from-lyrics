Yeah, yeah
Ahh, yeah

I live my life like there's no tomorrow
All I've got, I had to steal
Least I don't need to beg or borrow
Yes, I'm livin' at a pace that kills


Runnin' with the devil 
Runnin' with the devil


I found the simple life ain't so simple
When I jumped out on that road
I got no love, no love you'd call real
Ain't got nobody waitin' at home


Runnin' with the devil

Runnin' with the devil 

Whoo
Whoo

You know uh, I found the simple life weren't so simple, no
When I jumped out on that road
Got no love, no love you'd call real
Got nobody waitin' at home


Runnin' with the devil

Runnin' with the devil



Runnin' with the devil 
Runnin' with the devil 
Runnin' with the devil 
Runnin' with the devil
