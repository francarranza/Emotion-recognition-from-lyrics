As I write this letter
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you

Treasure these few words
'Til we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S. I love you
You, you, you

I'll be coming home again to you, love
And 'til the day I do, love
P.S. I love you
You, you, you

Send my love to you (you know I want you to)

Be in love with you

I'll be coming home again to you, love
And 'til the day I do, love

You, you, you
