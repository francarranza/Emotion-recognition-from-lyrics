He's up to something.
She's up to something.
And I can't breathe.

4 A.M.
And I was sleeping, but the phone just rang.
Dead air.
And someone breathing who's up to something.

I'll leave and let you go
And though you're moving a little too slow.
I'll even let you know
You did the right thing.

He's...
She's...
And I can't breathe. And I can't breathe.

4 A.M.
And I was sleeping, but the phone just rang.
*Ring*
"Hello?"
Dead air.
And someone breathing who's up to something.

I'll leave and let you go
And though you're moving a little too slow.
I'll even let you know
You did the right thing.

*Ring*
"Hello?"
