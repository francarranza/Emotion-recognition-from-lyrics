You want to fly on the wings of an eagle
Everybody has to dream
Well you fight like a fighter, you look like no other

Take what you want; you think you'll ride with the demons
As deadly as the seven sins
You think that you're magic
But I'm no believer

And you fight like a little Contender
A broken heart you can never surrender
A thousand kisses return to sender

You words they come to no good intentions
You preach every word you say
Your sticks and your stones break more than my bones

You say you love me, then you hate me, then you're hot then cold
Head to toe in diamonds you're not undersold
You think that you're magic
But I'm no believer

And you fight like a little Contender
A broken heart you can never surrender

A thousand kisses return to sender
I want to help and I want to protect ya
But you got your spies telling lies
Where do you go? You change colours like a tiger in the snow

And you fight like a little Contender
A broken heart you can never surrender
A thousand kisses return to sender

I want to love girl but somehow I can't let you in
Disguised in all your makeup like the seven sins
You've got your magic
But I'm no believer

And you fight like a little Contender
A broken heart you can never surrender
A thousand kisses return to sender
I want to help and I want to protect ya
But you got your spies telling lies
Where do you go? You change colours like a tiger in the snow
