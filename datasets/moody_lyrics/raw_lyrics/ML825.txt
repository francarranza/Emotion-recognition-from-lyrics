Something in me, dark and sticky
All the time it's getting strong
No way of dealing with this feeling
Can't go on like this too long

This time you've gone too far
This time you've gone too far
This time you've gone too far
I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you

This time you've gone too far
This time you've gone too far
This time you've gone too far
I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you

Don't talk back, just drive the car
Shut your mouth, I know what you are
Don't say nothing, keep your hands on the wheel
Don't turn around, this is for real

Digging in the dirt, stay with me, I need support
I'm digging in the dirt to find the places I got hurt
Open up the places I got hurt

The more I look, the more I find
As I close on in, I get so blind
I feel it in my head, I feel it in my toes
I feel it in my sex, that's the place it goes

This time you've gone too far
This time you've gone too far
This time you've gone too far
I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you

This time you've gone too far
This time you've gone too far
This time you've gone too far
I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you

Don't talk back, just drive the car
Shut your mouth, I know what you are
Don't say nothing, keep your hands on the wheel
Don't turn around, this is for real

I'm digging in the dirt, stay with me I need support
I'm digging in the dirt to find the places I got hurt
Open up the places I got hurt

I'm digging in the dirt, stay with me I need support
I'm digging in the dirt to find the places I got hurt
To open up the places I got hurt

Digging in the dirt to find the places we got hurt
Digging in the dirt to find the places we got hurt
Digging in the dirt to find the places we got hurt
Digging in the dirt to find the places we got hurt
Digging in the dirt to find the places we got hurt
Digging in the dirt to find the places we got hurt
Digging in the dirt to find the places we got hurt
