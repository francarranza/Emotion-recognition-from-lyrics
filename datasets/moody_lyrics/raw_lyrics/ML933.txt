After work, me and the boys
Go down to Killey's and we make some noise
Feed that old jukebox and play some air guitar

Well and there's nothin' wrong with shootin' pool
And having some fun and acting a fool
But this time I won't be going where they are

'Cause I'm going home and rock my baby
Just thinkin' 'bout her is making me crazy
And all day long, I've been dreamin' of holding her tight

Yeah, it's gonna be a sweet surrender
Candlelight and love me tender
I'm going home and rock my baby tonight

The girl sure has been working hard
I thank she's ready for some R 'n' R
Something to take her mind off everything

Champagne and a box of candy
A dozen roses might come in handy
To help loosen up those apron strings

'Cause I'm going home and rock my baby
Just thinkin' 'bout her is making me crazy
All day long, I've been dreamin' of holding her tight

Yeah, it's gonna be a sweet surrender
Candlelight and love me tender
I'm going home and rock my baby tonight

If the roses and the candy do the trick
Tomorrow I may have to call in sick

'Cause I'm going home and rock my baby
Just thinkin' 'bout her is making me crazy
And all day long, I've been dreamin' of holding her tight

Yeah, it's gonna be a sweet surrender
Candlelight and love me tender
I'm going home and rock my baby tonight
Yeah, I'm going home and rock my baby tonight
