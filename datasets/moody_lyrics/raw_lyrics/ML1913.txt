If I could change my world
Things would be the same
There would still be love and pain
'Cause without it I would never change

If I took back all the loving that made me cry
Would I ever realize
That I'm growing from mistakes that I made
To make me change?

Love, it will never go
Love, even when you go
It never leaves, no, no
Love never changes, love

Love, it will never go
Love, even when you go
It never leaves
Love never changes, love

That's why I know
All of this is clear to me
Love is for eternity
That's the way God wanted it to be

So I've learned time don't stay still or move fast
Nothing stays the same but love lasts
And I can't keep living in the past
I gotta change

Love, it will never go
Love, even when you go
It never leaves
Love never changes, love

Love, it will never go
Love, even when you go
It never leaves
Love never changes, love

Love never changes
Love won't leave
Love never changes
You have to believe when it's love
Love never changes, love

Love never changes
Love never leaves
Love is so graceful
You gotta believe when it's love
Love never changes, love

Love, it will never go
Love, even when you go
It never leaves
Love never changes, love

Love, it will never go
Love, even when you go
It never leaves
Love never changes, love
