I'd move to Rockferry tomorrow
And I'd build my house, baby, with sorrow
I'll leave my shadow to fall behind
And I wouldn't write to you 'cause I'm not that kind

The midnight trains are boarding all reprobates
I pick my load and I fill my truck before it's too late
I leave the stars to judge my every move
I'm not going to think of you or I'll get the blues

There's no sleep on the journey away from town
A bag of songs and a heavy heart won't make me down
I'll give it all my strength and my might
I'll make this decision, win all the fights

I'll move to Rockferry tomorrow
And I'll build my house, baby, with sorrow
I'll leave my shadow to fall behind
And I wouldn't write to you 'cause I'm not that kind

Not that kind
Rockferry
Not that kind
Rockferry
Not that kind
Rockferry
Not that kind
Rockferry
Not that kind
Rockferry
Not that kind
Rockferry
Not that kind
Rockferry
Not that kind
Rockferry
