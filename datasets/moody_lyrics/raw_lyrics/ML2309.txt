I was down for so long
Everything I did was wrong
And I found fault
In everyone but me

I was hurt and alone
I could not find my way home
Broke-down and hungry
And too tired to moan

Then I heard somebody calling my name
Saying ain't no need to be shamed
I found out that the door was always open

I was trapped in my mind
A prisoner of my own design
Lost in a world
A world of confusion

I was there by myself
Couldn't find no help no where else
Thought I'd call up the hotline
But there was nobody there

Then I heard somebody calling my name
Saying ain't no need to be shamed
I found out that the door was always open

(Instrumental Bridge)

Then I heard somebody calling my name
Saying ain't no need to be shamed
I found out that the door was always open
