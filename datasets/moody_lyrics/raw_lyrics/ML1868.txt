I want to live, I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I never give

It keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
It keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line

That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
It keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

Oh yeah
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
Keeps me searching and I'm getting old
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
