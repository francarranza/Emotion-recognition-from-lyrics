Yeah
Lies

Look at me now, just sittin' here by myself
And I think you found someone else
Now I'm gonna have to find a way to put the bottle down
And why can't you see
That I'm drowning in a pool of misery?

I'm always afraid
That you'll go away from me
I'm always afraid
That you're lost in somebody
I'm always afraid
That you'll go away from me
I'm always afraid that you're lost

So here I am, I don't wanna be by myself
And I think you're fucking someone else
Now I'm gonna have to find a way to take the knife out of my back
And how could you leave me
Stranded in a closet full of bones?

I'm always afraid
That you'll go away from me
I'm always afraid
That you're lost in somebody
I'm always afraid
That you'll go away from me
I'm always afraid that you're lost

Maybe you could let me stay
Maybe just for one more day
You could help me stay the same
Maybe things won't ever change
Maybe we could taste the rain
You could push me out the way

Now I sit here by myself
Think about somebody else
How could you let them take you away from me?
There's somebody else 

I'm always afraid
That you'll go away from me
I'm always afraid
That you're lost in somebody
I'm always afraid
That you'll go away from me
I'm always afraid that you're fucking

I'm always afraid, I'm always afraid
I'm always afraid, I'm always afraid
I'm always afraid, I'm always afraid
I'm always afraid

Away from me
