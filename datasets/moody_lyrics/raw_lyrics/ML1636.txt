What will you say when the day comes, when it's no fun
When it's all done, when it's no fun
What will you say when the time comes, there's a dry run
When it's undone and there's no one

When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
It's too much love
Too much love
Too much

What will you do when you wake up, fatten you up
Fasten you up, fatten you up
No memories to get cloudy, to get cloudy
When you can't see what you can't see
It's all the same when it's morning and you're boring
Still ignoring everything
No memories to remind you of the old you
Nothing for it, just keep it up, keep it up

When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much

What will you say when the day comes, when it's no fun
When it's all done, when it's undone
What will you say when the time comes, there's a dry run
When it's undone and it's undone

When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
It's too much love
Too much love
Too much

What will you do when you wake up, fatten you up
Fasten you up, fatten you up
No memories to get cloudy, to get cloudy
When you can't see what you can't see
It's all the same when it's morning and you're boring
Still ignoring everything
No memories to remind you of the old you
Nothing for it, just keep it up, keep it up

When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much

With no memory, with no memory
With no memory to keep you up at night
With no memory, with no memory
With no memory to keep you up at night
