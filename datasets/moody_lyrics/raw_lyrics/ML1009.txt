Maybe we oughta think twice
Before we start something nice
No need to sacrifice the spice
In our lives, ooh

Your love's like fire and ice, pretty baby
That's why we oughta think twice
Before we start something nice
Think twice, think twice

I really love you
You know I do
I really love you
You know it's true

I really love you
You know I do
I really love you
You know it's true

Maybe we oughta think twice
Before we start something nice
No need to sacrifice the spice
In our lives, ooh

Your love's like fire and ice
That's why we oughta think twice
Before we start something nice
Think twice, think twice

I really love you
You know I do
Said I really love you
You know it's true

I really love you
You know I do
I said, I really love you
You know it's true

I really love you
You know I do
I said, I really love you
You know it's true

You know, I love you, baby
You know I do, think twice
I really love you, baby
You know I do, think twice

I really love you, baby
You know it's true, think twice
You know, I love you, baby
You know I do, think twice
