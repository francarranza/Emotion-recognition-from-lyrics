Tired of falling backwards
Tired of all the deceit...

I'll show no allegiance
All shall feel my wrath
Ten years of discontent never given a chance
But love is passion, may love is vengeance
And this love I shall foresake
And on this day I slit my wrist
And do away with everything, fuck it

Cut up bleeding beaten cheated
I'm tired of falling backwards
I'm tired of all the deceit...
Fuck all of the people driven by the greed
They will all be dealt with accordingly
Just let them be, FUCK IT

I'm tired of falling backwards
I'm tired of all the deceit
I'm tired of falling backwards
I'm tired of people trying to take a piece

Wage war on the bastards
Wage war on the street
Wage war all around you
Wage war on the weak

Tired of falling backwards
I'm tired of all the deceit...

Wage war on the bastards
Wage war on the street
Wage war all around you
Wage war on the weak
