Metal and men clash once more to the end
Warriors above with power to kill descend
Militia of blood, troops of hate march to die
Soldiers of Hell, veterans of death arise

Prepare for attack, your body will burn
Endless war, there's no return
Prepare for attack, death will arrive
Your orders are clear, no way to hide
Fight till death

Senseless death of all mankind overtakes
Armored assassins destroy at will your escape
Children of sorrow are trampled onto the grave
There is no future, no fucking world to be saved

Prepare for attack, your body will burn
Endless war, there's no return
Prepare for attack, death will arrive
Your orders are clear, no way to hide
Fight till death

To reign in Hell

Gods of steel unleash their destruction on man
Reign of death what is the final command
Sceptres of hate are dropped upon this Earth
Clouds of terror destroy all hope of rebirth

Prepare for attack, your body will burn
Endless war, there's no return
Prepare for attack, death will arrive
Your orders are clear, no way to hide
Fight till death

Fight till death
Fight till death
Fight till death
