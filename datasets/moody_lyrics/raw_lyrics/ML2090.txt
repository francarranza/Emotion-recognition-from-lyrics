Walking a fine line between wrong and right
And I know...
There is a part of me that I try to hide
But I can't win
And I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight
Running away from the world outside

Now I am calling
Hoping you'll hear me
We all need somebody
To believe in something
And I won't fear this
When I am falling
We all need somebody
That can mend... These broken bones

Caught in the confines of the simple life
And I am...
Holding my head high in the rising tide
And I can't win
And I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight
Running away from the world outside

Now I am calling
Hoping you'll hear me
We all need somebody
To believe in something
And I won't fear this
When I am falling
We all need somebody
That can mend... These broken bones

But Oh
Yeah

I'm not coming home now
I know...
I'm so far away
So far from home
I'm not coming home now
I know...
I'm so far away
I'm so far away

And I can't win
And I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight

Now I am calling
Hoping you'll hear me
We all need somebody
To believe in something
And I won't fear this
When I am falling
We all need somebody
That can mend... These broken bones

And I can't win
And I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight
Running away from the world outside

And I can't win
And I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight
Running away from the world outside
