One, two, three

Well you better listen my sister's and brothers,
'Cause if you do you can hear
There are voices still calling across the years.
And they're all crying across the ocean,
And they're cryin across the land,
And they will till we all come to understand.

None of us are free.
None of us are free.
None of us are free, if one of us are chained.
None of us are free.

And there are people still in darkness,
And they just can't see the light.
If you don't say it's wrong then that says it right.
We got try to feel for each other, let our brother's know that we care.
Got to get the message, send it out loud and clear.

None of us are free.
None of us are free.
None of us are free, if one of us are chained.
None of us are free.

It's a simple truth we all need, just to hear and to see.
None of us are free, if one of us is chained.
None of us are free.
Now I swear your salvation isn't too hard too find,
None of us can find it on our own. (On our own)
We've got to join together in sprirt, heart and mind.
So that every soul who's suffering will know they're not alone.

Oh, none of us are free.
None of us are free, yo
None of us are free, if one of us are chained.
None of us are free.

If you just look around you,
Your gonna see what I say.
Cause the world is getting smaller each passing day. (Passing day)
Now it's time to start making changes,
And it's time for us all to realize,
That the truth is shining real bright right before our eyes. (Before our eyes)

None of us are free.
None of us are free.
None of us are free, if one of us is chained.
None of us are free.

Oh, none of us are free.
None, none, none of us (None of us are free)
Oh, none one of us
(None of us are free, if one of us is chained) Well, well,
Well, once again

(None of us are free) None of us are free
(None of us are free) None of us are free
(None of us are free, if one of us is chained) One of us, none of us, one of us

(None of us are free) Lord, have mercy
(None of us are free) Oh, let me save you
(None of us are free, if one of us is chained)
If one of us is chained, none of us are free.
Well, I gotta tell about it

(None of us are free) Oh, ma ma ma
(None of us are free) Ma ma Lord
None of us are free, if one of us is chained.
None of us are free.

None of us, none of us, none of us are free.
None of us are free.
None of us are free, if one of us is chained.
None of us are free.

None of us are free.
None of us are free, no
None of us are free, (if one of us is chained), oh, Lord
(None of us are free) oh, Lord

None of us are free.
(None of us are free)
None of us are free, if one of us is chained.
None of us are free.
