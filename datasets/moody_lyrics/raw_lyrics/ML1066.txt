Do me wrong, do me right, do me right baby. Tell me lies, but hold me tight. Save your goodbyes for the morning light, but don't let me be lonely tonight.

Say goodbye, woman say hello, hello, hello.
Sho nuf good to see you, oh but it's time to go.

Don't say yes, but please, please don't say no. I don't wanna be lonely tonight. Go away, then damn you. Go do as you please, go do as you please girl. You ain't gonna see me getting down on my knees.

Girl I'm undecided and your hearts been divided. You've been turning my world upside down. Hey hey, upside down yeah, whoo whoo.
