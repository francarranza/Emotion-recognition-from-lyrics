Holly's in the window
Homeward the wind blows
Can't walk for runnin'

'Cause Christmas time's a-coming

Can't you hear them bells ringin', ringin'?
Joy, joy don't cha hear them singin'
When it's snowin 'I'll be goin'
Back to my country home

Christmas time's a-coming
Christmas time's a-coming
Christmas time's a-coming
And I know I'm goin' home

White candle's burnin'
My old heart's a-yearnin'
For the folks at home when
Christmas time's a-coming

Can't you hear them bells ringin', ringin'?
Joy, joy don't cha hear them singin'
When it's snowin 'I'll be goin'
Back to my country home

Christmas time's a-coming
Christmas time's a-coming
Christmas time's a-coming
And I know I'm goin' home

Snow flake's a-fallin'
My old heart's a-callin'
Tall pine's a-hummin'
Christmas time's a-coming

Can't you hear them bells ringin', ringin'?
Joy, joy don't cha hear them singin'
When it's snowin 'I'll be goin'
Back to my country home

Christmas time's a-coming
Christmas time's a-coming
Christmas time's a-coming
And I know I'm goin' home
