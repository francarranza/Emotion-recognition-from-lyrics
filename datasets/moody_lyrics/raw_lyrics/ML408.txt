Pardon me you left your tears on the jukebox
And I'm afraid they got mixed up with mine
I don't mean to pry it's just that I noticed you, goin' out of your mind
It look like we're two of a kind

Let's fall to pieces together
Why should we both fall apart
Let's fall to pieces together
Right here in each other's arms

Alone is much better together
When the worst is still yet to come
So let's share the rest of the tears that are left
From two hearts that just came undone
Why should we go crazy alone

Let's fall to pieces together
Why should we both fall apart
Let's fall to pieces together
Right here in each other's arms

Let's fall to pieces together, right here, in each other's arms
