I don't care where I go
When I'm with you
When I cry, you don't laugh

I can't feel any more
Than I'm singing, yeah

I'm in you, you're in me
I'm in you, you're in me
'Cause you gave me the love
Love that I never had
You gave me the love
Love that I never had

Come so far when you think
Of last fall
You can't buy what we made
You and I, oh

I'm in you, you're in me
I'm in you, you're in me
'Cause you gave me the love
Love that I never had
Yes, you gave me the love
Love that I never had
You gave me the love
Love that I never had

I don't care where I go
When I'm with
