She's like a little bird
She flies from A to B
To see what she can see
She's far away from me

We danced on the moon
We danced by the sea
The land of blue gold
Is where we were free

July-ly-ly, July-ly-ly, July-ly-ly
Where we were free
Where we were free

The shiny blackest crow
Flew in to say hello
Though much to her surprise
He had two mouths for eyes

She understood his words
That crow was very pleased
He gave to her his wings
And now she is free

July-ly-ly, July-ly-ly, July-ly-ly
Now we are free
Now we are free

July-ly-ly ly-ly-ly
Don't let it startle you today
July-ly-ly ly-ly-ly
There in the dark, calling me
Don't let it startle you

Don't let it startle you, little bird

July-ly-ly ly-ly-ly
Don't let it startle you today
July-ly-ly ly-ly-ly
