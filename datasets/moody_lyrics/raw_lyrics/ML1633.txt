I can't decide and I can't hide
Make up my mind it's a waste of time
Here comes the knife
You better just stand back
I could turn on you so fast

It's a hit its got soul
Steal the show with your rock n' roll
With a swing like that you better just stand back
I could turn on you so fast

Just like diamonds in your hand
I'll just cut you in the end

One more step and I'll slit your neck
You'll get use to it you better just stand back
I could turn on you so fast
I could turn on you so fast
I could turn on you so fast
Just like diamonds in your hand
I could turn on you so fast
I just cut you in the end
I could turn on you so fast
