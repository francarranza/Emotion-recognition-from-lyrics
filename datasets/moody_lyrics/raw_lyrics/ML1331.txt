I can love you better
Lose myself in love ...

I used to do it for the love a long time ago
And all I ever wanted was love
I used to love without fear a long time ago
And all I ever wanted was love
Then somebody came around and tried to hurt me
Try to make me feel like I was unworthy
Took a pure love and tried to make it dirty
Truth was they never did deserve me no!

I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Love you better, lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is?

Couldn't tell me I was in love when I needed it
When, all I ever wanted was love.
Should a told me I was worth receiving it
But all I ever wanted was love
There's something awkward about the selflessness it
Takes to
Give love and the good that it makes you!
True love can never really forsake you
But it took a little while just for me to see!

I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Make it better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is?

I had a paralyzing fear of facing failure
And I couldn't love you perfectly with that fear in my head
So I perilously had to face the danger
So I could come back and love you whole instead
All of your soul I said!
So I could make it better

I had to lose myself had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Make it better

Lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is

And so it goes that I never meant to hurt you
Couldn't stay but I never meant to desert you
Whole lot a things I just had to work through
Time to heal and restore my self-worth too
Confrontation of my fears and anxiety
Cried a whole lot of years I suffered quietly
And though it may have taken years I can finally
Tell you that you were always on my mind!

I had to lose myself so I could love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Love you better baby better baby
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could love you better baby
Had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could love you better baby
Had to lose myself in love
Yeah, so I can love you better baby lose myself in love
Lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is!

Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did
Great love to absorb all the misuse I did
Hey baby it's not an excuse I give.
And I'd do it all again because for you I live

Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did
Great love to absorb all the misuse I did
Hey baby it's not an excuse I give.
And I'd do it all again because for you I live

Had to lose myself so I could love you better baby
Had to lose myself in love, so I could love you better baby
Had to lose myself in love again
So I could love you better baby baby
Had to lose myself in love again
So I could love you better baby baby baby
I can love you better baby, I could love you better, I could love you better
I can love you better I could love you better I could love you better
It sure feels right
That's just the way it is
