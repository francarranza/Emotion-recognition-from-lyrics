Oh I'm happy 
I'm happy 
Happy in Jesus 

He's the head of my life 
I'm happy 
Happy In Jesus 
From a world of sin 
He brought me out 
I was walking in darkness 
Shackled in sin 
But Jesus saved me 
And now I live for him 

I'm happy 
I'm happy 
I'm happy 
Happy in the Lord 

You don't know how happy I am 
On Christ the solid rock I stand 
You don't know what it means to me 
To have His Holy Ghost abiding in me 

Stepped in the water 
The water was cold 
It chilled my body 
But not my soul 
I'm so happy 
I'm happy 
I'm happy 
Happy in the Lord 

One of these old mornings 
Won't be very long 
You gonna' look for me 
And I'll be gone on home 
But I'll be happy 
Yes I will 
I'll be happy 
Oh happy 
Happy In the Lord 

I'm happy 
Happy in Jesus
