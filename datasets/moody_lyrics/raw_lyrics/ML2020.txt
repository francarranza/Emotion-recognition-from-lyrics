Hey, hey baby
I wanna know
If you'll be my girl

Hey, hey baby
I wanna know
If you'll be my girl

When I saw you walking down the street
I said that's the kind of gal I'd like to meet
She's so pretty, Lord, she's fine
I'm gonna make her mine all mine

Hey, hey baby
I wanna know
If you'll be my girl

When you turned and walked away
That's when I want to say
Come on, baby, give me a whirl
I wanna know if you'll be my girl

Hey, hey baby
I wanna know
If you'll be my girl

When you turned and walked away
That's when I want to say
Come on, baby, give me a whirl
I wanna know if you'll be my girl

Hey, hey baby
I wanna know
If you'll be my girl

Hey, hey baby
