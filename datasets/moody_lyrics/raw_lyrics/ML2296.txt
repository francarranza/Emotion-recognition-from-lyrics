One more young writer slid away in the night
Over the border he will drown in light

Hold it - wait a minute!
I can't read my writing - my own writing!
Like tiny insects in the palm of history
A domino effect in a cloud of mystery
It's an iron fist!
In a glove full of vaseline
Dip the fuse in the kerosene
I too became a dissident!
Became a dissident
Became a dissident

Courting disaster we ran in the night
Wings of an angel torn in flight

Check it - verify it!
It's all here in writing - my own writing!
Like tiny insects in the palm of history
A domino effect in a cloud of mystery
It's an iron fist!
In a glove full of vaseline
Dip the fuse in the kerosene
I too became a dissident!

Check it - verify it!
It's all here in writing - down in writing!
At the hands of the press
And in the eyes of the government
I fell from grace
I too became a dissident
I was a dissident, yeah
Like tiny insects in the palm of history
A domino effect and an early end to this story
There's an iron fist in a glove full of vaseline
Dip the fuse in the kerosene
I too became a dissident
