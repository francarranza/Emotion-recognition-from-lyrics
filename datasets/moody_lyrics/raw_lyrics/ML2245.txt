Right now let me testify, right now let me tell you why
Right now my life is so good everyday
Beautiful amazing grace, got to have You in my space
I just want to tell the world how I feel

Ooh, so good to be, so good to be in love
Ooh, without Your love, without Your love I'm lost
Ooh, don't take it away, don't take it away because
Ooh, without Your love, without Your love I'm lost

Right now I can see so clear, I hear Your voice in my ear
Telling me keep moving on, never stop
It penetrates deep in my soul, much more than incredible
Your joy makes me feel aglow, want the world to know

Sensational feeling You give to me
And I'm so gratified You'd let Your light shine on me
By now it's no secret that I adore You so much
You're so necessary in my life 'cause

Ooh, so good to be, so good to be in love
Ooh, without Your love, without Your love I'm lost
Ooh, don't take it away, don't take it away because
Ooh, without Your love, without Your love I'm lost
