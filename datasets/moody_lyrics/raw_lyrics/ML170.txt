Born from the fire clean, crawling in through the dirt like war
Five years, my mother gave a voice for war
Ten, I was dead born again with eyes for war
By fifteen, hate was the name of my war

Wash me in the river, give me to the pain of LifeWar
LifeWar

Twenty years gone and father told me life was like war
Hands to the bone, twenty-five years of war
Thirty, I wake to the sound of souls at war
I will pass through, buried with the flag of my war

Wash me in the river, give me to the pain of LifeWar
LifeWar
LifeWar, war
LifeWar, LifeWar
LifeWar
