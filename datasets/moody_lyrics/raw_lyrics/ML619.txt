There is something on my mind that's in my heart written on my face
And it would behove me and my soul if I did state my case
And so as truth is real and real is truth this truly must be told
That you've got to be the sweetest somebody I Know

It's your love for life, your love for God, your love for love and more
And you express your love in ways like I've never known before
If there's a record kept on who's the sweetest let the record show
That you've got to be the sweetest somebody I Know

You are the sweetest somebody I know
And that is why I can't help but love you so

In a time when people are on with making sure that they're okay
You pour out your love every second, every minute, every hour of the day
I'm not trying to blow your horn I'm only saying what is so
That you've got to be the sweetest somebody I Know

You are the sweetest somebody I know
And that is why I can't help but love you so

When I feel like from giving up from seeing all life's pain and strife
You rejuvenate me saying everything's gonna be all right
If there's a place called "heaven" bet my life someday you're gonna go
'Cause you've got to be the sweetest somebody I Know

You are the sweetest somebody I know
And that is why I can't help but love you so [repeat]
