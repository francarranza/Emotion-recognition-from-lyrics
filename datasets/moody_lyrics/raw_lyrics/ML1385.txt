I can hear you sighin'
Say you'll stay beside me
Why must it be
You always creep
Into my dreams

On the beach we're sitting
Hugging, squeezing, kissing
Why must it be
You always creep
Into my dreams
In my dreams

When I'm asleep at night baby
I feel those moments of ecstasy
When you sleep at night baby
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be, I sleep alone in my fantasy

Oh, love is so amazing
Guess you will be staying
So let it be
You always creep
Into my dreams
In my dreams

When I'm asleep at night baby
I feel those moments of ecstasy
When you sleep at night baby
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be, I sleep alone in my fantasy

Oh, love is so amazing
Guess you will be staying
So let it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams
In my dreams...
