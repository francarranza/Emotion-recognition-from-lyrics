Take me down to the paradise city

Just an urchin livin' under the street
I'm a hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case so buy me somethin' to eat
I'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line

Rags to riches or so they say
You gotta keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
You know it's, it's all a gamble when it's just a game

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home, yeah, yeah?

Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home

Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here, I can't quite remember
The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe
I'd have another cigarette but I can't see
Tell me who ya gonna believe

Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah, yeah
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home, yeah?

So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away

Now he's a court jester with a broken heart
He said "Turn me around and take me back to the start"

Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah, yeah
