Now this one's dedicated to all the youths
Who want to say nice things to all dem girls (heh, heh, heh)
Treat her like diamonds and pearls
Dedicated to all the girls around the world
(Now) Now this is Rayvon and Shaggy
With a combination you can't miss (heh, heh, heh)
Flip this one 'pon the musical disc (Yeah)
Well, ah ah, wah wah wah 

Girl, you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Closer than my peeps, you are to me, baby
Shorty, you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Girl, you're my friend when I'm in need, lady

Life is one big party when you're still young
But who's gonna have your back when it's all done 
It's all good when you're little you're pure fun
Can't be a fool son, what about the long run 

Looking back Shorty always a mention
Say me not giving her much attention 
She was there through my incarceration
I wanna show the nation my appreciation

Girl, you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Closer than my peeps, you are to me, baby
Shorty, you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Girl, you're my friend when I'm in need, lady

You're a queen and that's how you should be treated
Though you never get the lovin' that you needed 
Coulda left, but I called and you heeded
Begged and I pleaded, mission completed 

Mama said now that I dissed the program
Not the type to mess around with her emotion 
But the feeling that I have for you is so strong
Been together so long and this could never be wrong

Girl, you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Closer than my peeps, you are to me, baby
Shorty, you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Girl, you're my friend when I'm in need, lady

Girl, in spite of my behavior, said I'm your savior

And you appear to me so tender, say girl I surrender


Girl, in spite of my behavior, well, you are my savior

And you appear to me so tender, well, girl I surrender


Now life is one big party when you're still young
And who's gonna have your back when it's all done
It's all good when you live to have pure fun
Can't be a fool son, what about the long run 

Looking back shorty, always a mention
Say me not giving her much attention 
She was there through my incarceration
I wanna show the nation my appreciation

Girl, you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Closer than my peeps, you are to me, baby
Shorty, you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Girl, you're my friend when I'm in need, lady

Girl, you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Closer than my peeps, you are to me, baby
Shorty, you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Girl, you're my friend when I'm in need, lady
