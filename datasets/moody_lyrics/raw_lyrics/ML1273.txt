Can't find the answers
I've been crawling on my knees
Looking for anything
To keep me from drowning

Promises have been turned to lies
Can't even be honest inside
I'm running backwards
Watchin' my life wave me goodbye 

I'm running blind, I'm running blind
Somebody help me see I'm running blind

Searching for nothing
Wondering if I'll change
I'm trying everything
But everything still stays the same

I thought if I showed you I could fly
Wouldn't need anyone by my side
I'm running backwards
With broken wings I know I'll die

I'm running blind, running blind
Somebody help me see I'm running blind
Running blind, running blind
I'm running blind

I can't find the answers
I've been crawling on my knees
Looking for anything
To keep me from drowning

I'm running blind, I'm running blind
Running blind, I'm running blind

I'm running blind, I'm running blind
Running blind, I'm Running blind

Running blind
