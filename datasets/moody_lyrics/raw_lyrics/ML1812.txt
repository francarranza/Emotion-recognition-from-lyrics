If you see me walking down the street
(I got nothing but love for you)

Even if you trying to diss me
(I got nothing but love for you)

It don't matter if I'm riding high or low
(I got nothing but love for you)

No matter where I'm about to go
I got nothing but love for you

I got nothing but love for you
I got nothing but love for you
I got nothing but love for you
I got nothing but love for you

You may have a different point of view
(I got nothing but love for you)

I don't care if it ain't the same to me
(I got nothing but love for you)

If I see you riding high and low
(I got nothing but love for you)

It don't matter what you say or do
I got nothing but love for you

I got nothing but love for you
I got nothing but love for you
I got nothing but love for you
I got nothing but love for you
