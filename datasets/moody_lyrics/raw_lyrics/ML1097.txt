I, I heard you say

See the road, long and lonesome road
Dozens come from many miles away
See the lights, they go long for miles
But you will never see the light again in his smile
Now you are gone, are they moving on?
Don't listen girl, listen what they say
Got no soul, got no rock and roll
And you will never hold me in his arms again, I am so cold 

And I, I heard you say, I, I heard you say
Almost took my breath away
No, he will never hold me in his arms again 
You will never hold me in his arms again
No, he will never hold me in his arms again, I'm so cold

And I, I heard you say, I, I heard you say
Almost took my breath away
No, he will never hold me in his arms again 
You will never hold me in his arms again
No, he will never hold me in his arms again, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
No, he will never hold me in his arms again 
You will never hold me in his arms again
No, he will never hold me in his arms again, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
