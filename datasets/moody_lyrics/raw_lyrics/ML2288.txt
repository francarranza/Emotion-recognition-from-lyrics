Beating rapidly
Looking down from here
If I were to fall (From the tower, far to fall)
Could I return?
Incapacitate
Walls the spoke to me
Words lost in the fire (From the cellar far to climb)
I'll rise in smoke
Don't let me down, let me go
I'll bide my time in vertigo
Don't let me down, let me fall
Won't tie you up
Let me go, let me fall
I'll bite my tongue
Won't let you break the fall
Find the horizon
Planted on the ground
Shadows changing form
Find it moving
