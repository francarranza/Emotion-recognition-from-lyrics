Welcome to my nightmare
I think you're gonna like it
I think you're gonna feel you belong
A nocturnal vacation
Unnecessary sedation
You want to feel at home 'cause you belong

Welcome to my nightmare, whoa-whoa-oh

Welcome to my breakdown
I hope I didn't scare you
That's just the way we are when we come down
We sweat and laugh and scream here
'Cause life is just a dream here
You know inside you feel right at home here

Welcome to my breakdown, whoa-whoa-oh
You're welcome to my nightmare, yeah-yeah-ah

Welcome to my nightmare
I think you're gonna like it
I think you're gonna feel you belong
We sweat and laugh and scream here
'Cause life is just a dream here
You know inside you feel right at home here

Welcome to my nightmare, ooh-ooh-ooh
Welcome to my breakdown

Yeah
