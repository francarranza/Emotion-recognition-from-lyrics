I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
It won't mean a thing dear if you're not here with me.

I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
And when those blue heartache starts hurtin'
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.

Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
It won't mean a thing dear if you're not here with me.

I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
And when those blue heartache starts hurtin'
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.

Ooh, ooh, yeah, I'll have a blue, blue, blue Christmas
