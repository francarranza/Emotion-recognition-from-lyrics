Bo Diddley buy his baby diamond ring 
If that diamond ring don't shine
He gonna take it to a private eye
If that private eye can't see
He better not take the ring from me

Bo Diddley caught a nanny goat
To make his pretty baby a Sunday coat
Bo Diddley caught a feral cat
To make his pretty baby a Sunday hat

Mojo come to my house with black cat bone
A-take my baby all away from home
Ugly that Mojo, where has he been
Up your house and gone again
Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley have you heard
My pretty baby said she was a bird
