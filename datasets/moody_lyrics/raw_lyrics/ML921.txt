It never really mattered too much to me
That you were just too damned old for me
All that really mattered that you was my girlfriend
And baby that's all that mattered to me

Let me love you down
Even if it takes all night
Let me love you down
You know it's gonna be so right

Remember when I drove you home from work
I love the way when you kissed me bye
All your friends think I'm just too young for you
You tell 'em
That I can do what guys their age can do

Let me love you down
Even if it takes all night
Let me love you down
You know it's got to be so right

Let me love you down
Even if it takes all night
Let me love you down
You know it's got to be so right

It never really mattered too much to me
That you were too damned old for me
All that really mattered was you were my girlfriend
And baby that's all that mattered to me
baby

Let me love you down
Let me love you down
You know it's gonna be so right

Let me love you down
Let me love you down
You know it's gonna be so right

I can love you down

Let me love you, love you, love you, love you
Let me love you, love you, love you, love you
Let me love you down (Love you down)
I know, I know I could
Let me love you down (Love you down)
I know it's gonna take all night

Let me love you down (Love you down)
No no no no
Let me love you down (Love you down)

Let me love
From dawn
Take the house and car
I love like you are

Love you down, down, down baby
Love you down, down, down

I know, I know I could, yeah
Let me love you down
It's just me and you the whole night through

Let me love you baby
I know, I know I could
Love you down, down

Let me love you
I know I could baby
You're so sweet to me

Let me love you down, oh baby
It's just you and me baby
The whole night through
Won't you let me love you down
I can't take this too much longer, you know
