I don't know
I cannot see
Who we are now
How it used to be

Is it you or is it me
Look in the mirror
We are a fading memory

Where are we?
We got lost
In the cold

I will live again, you'll see
Tomorrow's not scaring me
Far away from yesterday
Just take the pain away

Fatal chaos
Hurtful lies
A broken dream
Is all we left behind

Is it you or is it me
Look in the mirror
Just a fading memory

Where are we?
We got lost
In the cold

I will live again, you'll see
Tomorrow's not scaring me
Far away from yesterday
Just take the pain away

-Solos-

I will live again, you'll see
Tomorrow's not scaring me
Far away from yesterday
Just take the pain away
