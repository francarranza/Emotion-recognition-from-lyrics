That turns my head and makes me look
Whoa whoa whoa uh uh uh... uh

That makes me pull single dollars
Out my pocket book, ooh baby
You're sexiness in my restitute makes me
Wanna cook my favorite recipe
And place it on your table, baby
You're in-toxic ting and so divine
You're the kind that stays on a sista's mind

And I know you'll think this is crazy
But, I got something better at home
Ooh whoo ooh woo woo

He's the kind that breaks it down
And curls my toes, woo woo woo baby ow
He's the kind that loves my mind and feeds my soul
And I love it baby

His intellect and outer respect, makes me wanna crawl
And be my best

Makes the hardest things
The simplest and I look but don't touch
