Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever (you give me fever) when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight (you give me fever)
Fever ... in the mornin'
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the day time
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right
You give me fever (you give me fever) when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight (you give me fever)
Fever ... in the mornin'
Fever all through the night (WOW!)

Everybody's got the fever
That is somethin' you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long time ago

(You give me fever)
Baby, turn on your love light (yeah, yeah)
Let it shine on me (yeah, yeah)
Well, baby, turn on your love light (yeah, yeah)
And let it shine on me (yeah, yeah)
Well, just a little bit higher (yeah, yeah)
And just a little bit brighter, baby (yeah, yeah)

You give me fever (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You give me fever (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You give me fever (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You give me fever
