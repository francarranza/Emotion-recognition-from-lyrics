Anoint my head anoint my feet
Send your angels raining down
Here on the battle ground
For your glory
Were taking territory
Fighting unseen enemies
Like never before
Were Waging War

I'm tired of principalities
Messing with me
(Waging war)
I'm tired of the devil
Stealing from me
(Waging war)
I promise he won't get
One more thing
(Waging war)
I'm taking it back
Taking territory
(Waging war)
I'm ready for the battle
I'm ready to win
(Waging war)
My weapon of power
He lives within
(Waging war)
I can't be defeated
The enemy gotta flee
(Waging war)
I'm taking it back
Taking territory

Going into battle
Going into battle

Be my sword
Be my shield
As we claim the victory
Over the enemy
In your name
You rule and rain
Never being defeat
Anymore
Were waging war

Send your fire
Send your fire

Fire by night
Cloud by day
A strong tower
Send the latter rain
Lion of Judah
Lord, God,
Mighty In battle
Since you did
It back then
We know you'll do
It again

Were going into battle
Were going into battle

Waging war
