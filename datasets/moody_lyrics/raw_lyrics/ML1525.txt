Deep river woman
Lord I'm coming home to you
Deep river woman
Lord I know she's waiting
Just anticipating all my love

I spent a night
Just another chance to see you
Just you and I
Wanted you to know
That my playing days are over
Cause all I do is think of you
The writing's on the wall

I've been out in the world
Yes, the fast life had me going

Now all that's changed
I finally make up my mind
About the one thing
I've been knowing
You're the only girl
I've ever crying for in this world

You kind of love is forever
It took me a long time to realize
That I've come so far
And end up going nowhere
Oh, girl, I need you by my side
