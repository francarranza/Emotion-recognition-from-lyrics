I was a teenage anarchist
Looking for revolution
I had the style, I had the ambition
Read all the authors, I knew the right slogans

There was no war but the class war
I was ready to set the world on fire
I was a teenage anarchist
Looking for revolution

Do you remember
When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?
Do you remember
When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?

I was a teenage anarchist
But the politics were too convenient
In the depths of their humanity
All I saw was bloodless ideology

With freedom as their doctrine
Guess who was the new authority
I was a teenage anarchist
But the politics were too convenient

Do you remember
When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?
Do you remember
When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?

When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire

I was a teenage anarchist
But then the scene got too rigid
It was a mob mentality
They set their rifle sights on me

Narrow visions of autonomy
You want me to surrender my identity
I was a teenage anarchist
The revolution was a lie

Do you remember
When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?
Do you remember
When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?

When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire
When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire

I was a teenage anarchist
I was a teenage anarchist
I was a teenage anarchist
I was a teenage anarchist
