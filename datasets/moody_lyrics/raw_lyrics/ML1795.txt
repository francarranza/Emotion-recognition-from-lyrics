You're so much different than me this I know-oh-oh
And I'm my only enemy pain is all that I can see whoa-oh-oh-oh
I see you're climbing a tree and I know-oh-oh
That it's easier to be up high in the air than on the ground

Is it love?
Yes, it's love
No, it's love
Must be love
This is love
Yes, it's love
No, it's love
Must be love
And it's love
Guess it's love
This is love
Must be love
It is love
Yes, it's love
No, it's love
Must be love
Guess it's love
No, it's love
This is love
Must be love
It is love no there's no doubt

You say you can't say anymore, you've already said it before
In a million different ways which were all not quite right

The rain is loud on the ground yes I know-oh-oh
And I don't even make a sound when I come around oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
And you say I'd be better off dead well I know
But there's no use hiding this pretty head in the ground

And it's love
Yes, it's love
No, it's love
Must be love
This is love
Yes, it's love
No, it's love
Must be love
You think love
Yes, it's love
No, it's love
Must be love
And it's love
Is it love?
Yes it's love
No, it's love baby
Love is it love?
This is love
Must be love
It is love no there's no doubt

We can do the Zarathustra, we can do the broken fist
We can tear down all the borders or abbreviate the list
And when finally the finish line emerges from the mist
We'll sound a soft alarm
