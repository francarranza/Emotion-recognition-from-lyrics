I lost at love before
Got mad and closed the door
But you said try, just once more

I chose you for the one
Now we're having so much fun
You treated me so kind
I'm about to lose my mind

You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life

The others were untrue
But when it came to loving you
I'd spend my whole life with you

Cause you came and you took control
You touched my very soul
You always showed me that
Loving you is where it's at

You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life

Thank you baby, yeah yeah

I love you so much it seems
You're even in my dreams
I can hear, baby
I can hear you calling
I'm so in love with you
All I ever want to do is
Thank you baby, thank you baby

You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life
You made me so very happy
You made me so, so very happy, baby
I'm so glad you came into my life

I wanna thank you, girl
Every day of my life, I wanna thank you
You made me so very happy
Oh, I wanna spend my life with you
Thank you baby, thank you baby
Thank you baby, thank you baby
