Watching for hours
Like wilting flowers
Blame it on something

Pouring it over
Falling like soldiers
Thinking of nothing

Blank in your head 'cause it's hard to believe
And the ache in your bones goes from chest to your feet
Blank in your head 'cause it's hard to believe
And the ache in your bones goes from chest to your feet

Blank in your head, yeah, it's hard to accept
The loss that you feel isn't easy to heal
Blank in your head, yeah, it's hard to believe
And the ache in your bones goes from chest to your feet

Doesn't really matter what was said
I won't believe it, I won't believe it
Turn my back, I turn my head
I won't believe it, I won't believe it
I can't say another word
I can't breathe another lung
Shut my eyes, the world is gone
I won't believe it, I won't believe it

Skin full of indents
Making an entrance
Mind is in circles

Unravel your tongue
Smiling that you've won
It's not that simple

Blank in your head 'cause it's hard to believe
And the ache in your bones goes from chest to your feet
Blank in your head 'cause it's hard to believe
And the ache in your bones goes from chest to your feet

Blank in your head, yeah, it's hard to accept
The loss that you feel isn't easy to heal
Blank in your head, yeah, it's hard to believe
And the ache in your bones goes from chest to your feet

Doesn't really matter what was said
I won't believe it, I won't believe it
Turn my back, I turn my head
I won't believe it, I won't believe it
I can't say another word
I can't breathe another lung
Shut my eyes the world is gone
I won't believe it, I won't believe it
