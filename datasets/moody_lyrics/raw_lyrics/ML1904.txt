Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Everybody knows, everybody knows
That you cradle the sun, sun
()
Living in remorse
Sky is over

Don't you want to hold me baby
Disappointed, going crazy

Even though we can't afford, the sky is over
Even though we can't afford, the sky is over
I don't want to see you go, the sky is over
Even though we can't afford, the sky is over

Behind closed eyes lie the mind's ready to awaken you
Are you at war with land and all of its creatures
Your not-so-gentle persuasion has been known to wreck economies
Of countries, of empires, the sky is over

Don't you want to hold me baby
Disappointed, going crazy

La, la-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-
La, la-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la

Not even from the sun
Not even from the sun
Not even from the sun
Don't you want me to run

Even though you can't afford, the sky is over
Even though we can't afford, the sky is over
I don't want to see you go, the sky is over
Even though we can't afford, the sky is over

I don't want to see you go, the sky is over
Even though we can't afford, the sky is over
I don't want to see you go, the sky is over
Even though we can't afford, the sky is over

The sky is over us
