I don't like the way he treats you
That's not the way that I would do you
What gives him the right to say
It's you that he owns

All those nights he left you to cry
Left you with nothing but tears in your eyes
Girl just come with me
'Cause this house is not a home

Girl he's over and gone
You don't have to hurt no more
And I'll be there for you
To give all the love you're yearning for

And you don't have to hurt no more, baby he's over
I'll be what you're looking for
Let me take over
And you don't have to hurt no more

I'll make you see
I'll be what you're looking for and more
So you don't have to hurt
You don't have to hurt

No more
How could he look into those pretty eyes
And hurt you, oh no
You don't have to hurt no more

Every day I see you with those sad eyes
You try so hard to hold back from all you cries
Just come with me
There is no reason for your broken heart to stand

Girl you're heart will heal from all the pain you feel
Just let me show you the real love you've been waiting for
Just close the door, you cannot take no more
There is no reason for

Girl he's over and gone
You don't have to hurt no more
And I'll be there for you
To give all the love you're yearning for

You don't have to hurt no more, baby he's over
I'll be what you're looking for
Let me take over
You don't have to hurt no more

I'll make you see
I'll be what you're looking for and more
So you don't have to hurt

You don't have to hurt, no more, baby he's over
I'll be what you're looking for
Let me take over
You don't have to hurt no more

I'll make you see
I'll be what you're looking for and more
So you don't have to hurt
You don't have to hurt, no more

He must be a fool to leave you alone

You don't have to hurt
