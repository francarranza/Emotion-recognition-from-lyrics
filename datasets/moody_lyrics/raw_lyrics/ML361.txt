Way across town a phone rings off the wall
If you know he ain't home why do you keep calling
Your gonna drive yourself crazy and you know that it's true
It's just making you wild and blue

Wild and blue, it's no wonder
Look at the things you do
They could just take you up yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue

In somebody's room on the far side of town
With your minds all made up
And the shades all pulled down
Someone is trying to satisfy you
He don't know you're wild and you're blue

Wild and blue, it's no wonder
Look at the things you do
They could just take you up yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue

It's four in the morning and your all alone
With no place to go, why don't you come home
I'll be right here, baby, waiting for you
I know you've been wild and blue

Wild and blue, it's no wonder
Look at the things you do
They could just take you up yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue

Wild and blue, it's no wonder
Look at the things you do
They could just take you up yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue
