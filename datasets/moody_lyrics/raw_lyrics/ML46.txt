Sleep and dream of this
Death Angel's kiss
Brings final bliss
Completely

Empty, they say
"Death, won't you let me stay?"
Empty, they say
"Death, hear me call your name!"
Ooh, call your name

Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Wait, wait patiently
Your death-black wings
Unfolding sleep
Spreading o'er me

Empty, they say
"Death, won't you let me stay?"
Empty, they say
"Death, hear me call your name!"
Ooh, call your name

Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Say, is that rain or are they tears
That stained your concrete face for years?
The crying, weeping, shedding strife
Year after year, life after life

An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel laid right down
Upon the grave which swallows fast
It's peace at last, oh, peace at last

Ooh, empty, they say
"Death, won't you let me stay?"
Empty, they say
"Death, hear me call your name!"
Call your name

Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Forevermore
Forevermore
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
