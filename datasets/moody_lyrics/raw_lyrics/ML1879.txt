When you get up, you get up
When you're down, you go down
I hope you're getting a kick out of this, sweetheart
I hope you're gonna laugh as much as you can

Try to do them right when they do you wrong
They might be writing you this song
We've got the same spider that's creeping in
And you know the kind of rough that you're a diamond in now

Baby, it's your life, baby, it's your life
You gotta love your life, have fun with your life

When you're in the zone, when you're on the shelf
When your real ID says you are somebody else
When you're on a plane, when you're uptown
Or you're in the nude, all wrapped up in a towel

If your high heel gets caught up in your gown
And you tumble down the stairs right into a crowd
I hope you're getting a kick out of this, sweetheart
I hope you're gonna laugh as much as you can

Baby, it's your life, baby, it's your life
You gotta live your life, have fun with your life
Baby, it's your life, baby, it's your life
You gotta live your life, have fun with your life

Don't freak out
Don't freak out
Don't freak out
...
