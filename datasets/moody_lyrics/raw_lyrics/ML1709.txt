People making lists, buying special gifts, 
It's a time to be kind to one and all 
It's that time of year when good friends are dear 
And you wish you could give more 
Than just presents from a store 

Why don't you give love on Christmas day (on Christmas day) 
Oh even the man who has everything 
Would be so happy if you would bring 
Him love on Christmas day (on Christmas day) 
No greater gift is there than love 

People you don't know smiling out hello 
Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy 
It's that once a year, when the world's sincere 
And you'd like to find a way 
To show the things that words can't say 

Why don't you give love on Christmas day (on Christmas day) 
The man on the street and the couple upstairs 
All need to know that there's one cares 
Give love on Christmas day (Christmas day) 
No greater gift is there than love 
What the world needs is love 
Yes the world needs your love 

Why don't you give love on Christmas day (on Christmas Day) 
Oh every little child on Santa's knee
Has room for your love underneath his tree
Give love on Christmas day (Christmas day) 
No greater gift is there than love 
What the world needs is love 
Yes the world needs your love
