Carve your rights into your arm 
So they won't get taken away 
Trying in vain to figure it out 
Always thinking this is a waste 

Build it up high 
The further to fall 
Right down on you 
Wasting away 

Suffer more, suffer still 
Found release locked away
No values anymore 
Nowhere to turn, wasted away

Build it up high
The further to fall
Right down on you
Wasting away

Suffer more, suffer still
Found release locked away
No values anymore
Nowhere to turn, wasted away

Build it up high
The further to fall
Right down on you
Wasting away
