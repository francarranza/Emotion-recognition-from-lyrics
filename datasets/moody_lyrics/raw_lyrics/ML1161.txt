If you hear a song in blue like a flower crying for the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss
If you hear a song that grows from my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose 
A prelude to a kiss
Though it's just a simple melody with nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a simphony a Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch 
Oh! How my love song gently cries for the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss.
