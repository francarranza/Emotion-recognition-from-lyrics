You build my hopes so high
And then you let me down so low
It makes no difference darlin'
I just love you more & more

Every time you smile
You know, I'm smiling with you
Every time you cry
You know I shed a few tears too

Ain't that lovin' you baby?
Ain't that lovin' you?
Oh that's lovin' you
Ain't that lovin' you baby?

I don't believe
I don't believe you know what I'm talkin' about
I don't believe
I don't believe you know what I'm talkin' about

I'm talkin' about love, love, love
I'm talkin' about love, love, love
I'm talkin' about love, love, love
I'm talkin' about love, love, love

You know I told you darlin'
That I'd never let you down
And no matter what you do
I'll always be around

You treat me like a schoolboy
That you know it's true
It makes no difference darlin'
I'll take care of you

Ain't that lovin' you baby?
Ain't that lovin' you?
Oh that's lovin' you
Ain't that lovin' you baby?

Ain't that lovin' you baby?
Ain't that lovin' you?
Oh that's lovin' you
Ain't that lovin' you baby?
I'm talkin' about love, love, love
I'm talkin' about love, love, love
I'm talkin' about love, love, love

You know I told you darlin'
I'll always be around
No matter what you do

Oh that's lovin' you 
Ain't that lovin' you baby?
Oh that's lovin' you
Love, love, love, love, love, love
