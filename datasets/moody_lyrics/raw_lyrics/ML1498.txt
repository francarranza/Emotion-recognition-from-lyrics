What have I got to do to make you love me, huh?
What have I got to do to make you care?
What do I do when lightning strikes me
And I wake to find that you're not there?

What have I got to do to make you want me, mmm?
What have I got to do to be heard
What do I say when it's all over
And sorry seems to be the hardest word?

Sad, so sad
It's a sad, sad situation 
And it's getting more and more absurd 
It's sad, so sad
Ehy can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me that sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad, so sad 
It's a sad, sad situation 
And it's getting more and more absurd 
It's sad, so sad 
Why can't we talk it over 
Oh, it seems to me that sorry seems to be the hardest word 

What do I do to make you love me?
What have I got to do to be heard?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
What have I got to do?
What have I got to do?
When sorry seems to be the hardest word
Oh yeah, sorry seems to be the hardest word
