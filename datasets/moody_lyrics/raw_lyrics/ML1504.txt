Monster hospital, can you please release me?
You hold my hands down, I've been bad
You hold my arms down, I've been bad
I've been bad, I've been bad!

I fought the war, I fought the war
I fought the war but the war won
I fought the war, I fought the war
I fought the war but the war won

Monster movie, Daddy Warbucks up against Bobby Fuller
And he beat him hands down
Lead in the head
Put a little lead in his head

I fought the war, I fought the war
I fought the war but the war won
I fought the war, I fought the war
I fought the war but the war won't stop for the love of God
I fought the war, I fought the war
I fought the war but the war won

I fought the war, I fought the war
I fought the war but the war won't stop for the love of God
I fought the war, I fought the war
I fought the war but the war won't stop for the love of God
I fought the war, I fought the war
I fought the war but the war won't stop for the love of God
I fought the war, I fought the war
I fought the war but the war won

I fought the war, I fought the war
I fought the war but the war won't stop for the love of God
I fought the war, I fought the war
I fought the war but the war won't stop for the love of God
I fought the war, I fought the war
I fought the war but the war won
