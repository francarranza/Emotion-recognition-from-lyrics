We're falling throughout eternity
The clock is ticking and you're still counting sheep
And you're still half asleep

There's no one coming (There's no one coming)
And there's no way out (And there's no way out)
I've been falling (Well I've been falling)
And it's so far down

Shrouded beneath a veil of tragedy
When Death comes calling
Who will you believe?
Tell me who would you believe
When it's down to you and me
Will you still stay on your knees?
Who will you believe?
When it's down to you and me

There's no one coming (There's no one coming)
And there's no way out (And there's no way out)
I've been falling (Well I've been falling)
And it's so far down (And it's so far down)
There's no one coming (There's no one coming)
And there's no way out
There's no way out
No way out

Pushing me down, breaking me down
There's always something pushing me down
Breaking me down
Pushing me down, breaking me down
There's always something pushing you down
Breaking me down
Pushing me down, breaking me down
There's always something pushing you down
Breaking me down
Pushing me down, breaking me down
There's always something pushing you back
Pushing you back
Rise!

I'm pushing you back, I'm pushing you back, rise
I'm pushing you back, I'm pushing you back, rise
I'm pushing you back, I'm pushing you back

There's no one coming
And there's no way out
Well I've been falling
And it's a long way down

Down
