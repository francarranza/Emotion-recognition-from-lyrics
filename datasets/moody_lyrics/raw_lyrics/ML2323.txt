Even when the world is grey
I go where I wanna go, I'm OK
Rainy skies don't cloud my mind
I do what I wanna do, do what I wanna do
I don't know anything but I
Say what I wanna say, say what I wanna say

Know that I want you

The sky in my mind is always blue
In my world the sun shines from you

Often I know I don't see
The waves of love that wash over me
Your love is a paradigm
For a man just looking for the next cheap rhyme
Visualizing paradise is a
Thing I don't wanna do, a thing I don't wanna do

But I know that I want you

The sky in my mind is always blue
In my world the sun shines from you

Life traces the line in space between
What's gone and what's gonna be
Time chases me, my mind races
To find the place where I wanna be

The sky in my mind is always blue
In my world the sun shines from you

Know that I want you
Know that I want you (end)
