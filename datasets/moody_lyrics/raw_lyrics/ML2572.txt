Ooh
Something's got a hold on me now
It's a feelin'
Burnin' like a love on fire

Hold me tight, babe
Don't leave me by myself tonight
'Cause I don't think I can make it through the night

I think I'm in love
And my life's looking up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough 
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love

It surrounds me
Moving like a sea of madness
It controls me
Makes me do all the things that I do for you

Blow my mind, babe
Thinkin' about you now
And I don't know if I'll make it through the night

I think I'm in love
And my life's looking up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough 
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love

I think I'm in love
Oh no, no, no

I think I'm in love
And my life's looking up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough 
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love

Baby, how you do it
There must be something to it

 Babe now it's gotta be love
The magic's in your hand 
 You made me understand
I know, I know it's gotta be love

 It's gotta be love
 and my life's looking up 
I think I'm in love
