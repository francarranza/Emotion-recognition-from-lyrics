Yankee soldier
He wanna shoot some skag
He met it in Cambodia
But now he can't afford a bag

Yankee dollar talk
To the dictators of the world
In fact it's giving orders
An' they can't afford to miss a word

I'm so bored with the USA
I'm so bored with the USA
But what can I do?

Yankee detectives
Are always on the TV
'Cause killers in America
Work seven days a week

Never mind the stars and stripes
Let's print the Watergate Tapes
I'll salute the New Wave
And I hope nobody escapes

I'm so bored with the USA
I'm so bored with the USA
But what can I do?

I'm so bored with the USA
I'm so bored with the USA
But what can I do?

I'm so bored with the USA
I'm so bored with the USA
I'm so bored with the USA
But what can I do?

Move up Starsky
For the C.I.A.
Suck on Kojak
For the USA
