There's a war coming down between my brothers and I
I don't want no war going down, going down tonight

Stop this war
Stop this war

Civilization, ha, I call it as I see it
I call this bullshit, you know, I still cannot believe it
Our evolution now has gone the way of hate
A world evolved, resolved in this stupid fate

Stop this war
Stop this war

All so different, yeah, I say we're all the same
All caught, you know, in the division game
Self destruction, fast impending like a bullet
No one can stop it; once it's fired, no one can control it

Stop this war
Stop this war

A final word, wait, it's not a call to action
We ain't no sect, no, this ain't no fucking faction
Unity, unity, unity, you've heard it all before
This time it's not exclusive, we want to stop a war

Stop this war
Stop this war

Ain't nothing wrong with another unity song
Ain't nothing wrong with another unity song
Ain't nothing wrong
Ain't nothing wrong
Ain't nothing wrong
Ain't nothing wrong with a unity song

Stop this war
Stop this war

Unity, as one stand together
Unity, evolution's gonna come, right
Unity, as one stand together
Unity, evolution's gonna come
Unity, as one stand together
Unity, evolution's gonna come
Unity, as one stand together
Unity, evolution's gonna come
