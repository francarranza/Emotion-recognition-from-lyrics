A day in the life of a fool
A sad and a long lonely day
I walk the avenue
Hoping to run into
The very sight of you coming my way.

I stop just in front of our door
But you're never there any more
So back to my room

And here in the gloom
I cry tears of goodbye

Till you come back to me
That's the way it will be
Everyday in the life of a fool
