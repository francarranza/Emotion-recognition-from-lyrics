He wants some angry young men
Ones who can't be bought
Ones who will not run from a fight
Ones who speak the truth whether it's popular or not
Ones who'd give up anything to walk in His light

Rest assured when Jesus comes again
He'll be looking for some angry young men

He wants some angry young men
With fire in their eyes
Ones who understand what Jesus gave
Ones who have grown weary
Of the world and all its lies
Ones who won't forget
They've been delivered from the grave

Rest assured when Jesus comes again
He'll be looking for some angry young men

The say if you don't laugh you cry
They say if you don't live you die
Well, well, the road to hell
Is paved with some impressive alibis
But unless you thirst for Jesus first

Man, heaven will pass you by
Heaven will pass you by

You'll be tempted, tried and tested
There'll be wars the devil wins
But God's love is not a license
To lie there in your sins
He understands the human heart
His mercy is complete
But His grace was not intended
As a place to wipe your fee

Rest assured when Jesus comes again
He'll be looking for some angry young men

He wants some angry young me
Who love the Lord they serve
Ones who'll do much more than make a speech
Ones who'll act their faith out
With the passion it deserves
'Cause if we cannot live it
Tell me, who are we to preach?

Rest assured when Jesus comes again
He'll be looking for some angry young men
