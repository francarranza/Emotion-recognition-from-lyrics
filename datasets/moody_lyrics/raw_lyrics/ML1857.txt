What are you crying for?
What is your desire?
How can I help a poor soul?
Swallow the solution I offer you
Exhale and you lose all your fear

Just give it a try
You want to
So I do what you ask me to do

It's never too late for a twist of fate
Believe and elate your mind
And try to segregate the feelings you hate
On my watch you'll be able to fly

Don't you feel better now?
Rely onto me
My cure is a lifetime deal
Love me and hate me
Fear me and take me
Die a thousand times

I just want to be another me
'Cause I can't stand the uncertainty
Why can't I just see another side of myself

Just give it a try
You want to
So I do what you ask me to do

It's never too late for a twist of fate
Believe and elate your mind
And try to segregate the feelings you hate
On my watch you'll be able to fly
