I am disappointed
Every morning that I wake up
And I am disappointed by the feeling
Of waking up next to you
You call me up, let me know that
That my sick guilt's
So unwelcome
It's so unwelcome yeah

I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness in your voice
I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness inside you

My health is failing me
So I flip on the television
And watch sad movies
And you look for sad sick people like me
Call me up, and let me know that
That my sick guilt is so unwelcome
I'm so unwelcome I'm so unwelcome

I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness in your voice
I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness inside you

You could go
We could go
Through the front door
You could go

We go in through the front door
We could go
We go in through the front door
We could go
I come in through the front door
Through the front door

And the pills they will not
Will not will not will not let me go
And I will not will not
Will not let you drink yourself alone
Call me up and let me know that
That my sick guilt is so unwelcome
You're so unwelcome you're so unwelcome

I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness in your voice
I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness inside you
I hear noises in the darkness
I hear sadness inside you
I hear sadness inside you
