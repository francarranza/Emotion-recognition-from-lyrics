If I was the sun way up there
I'd go with love most everywhere
I'll be the moon when the sun goes down
Just to let you know that I'm still around

That's how strong my love is, whoa
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is, baby, baby
That's how strong my love is

I'll be the weeping willow drowning in my tears
And you can go swimming when you're here
And I'll be the rainbow after the tears are gone
Wrap you in my colors and keep you warm

That's how strong my love is, darling
That's how strong my love is, baby
That's how strong my love is, whoa
That's how strong my love is

I'll be the ocean so deep and wide
And get all the tears whenever you cry
I'll be the breeze after the storm is gone
To dry your eyes and love you warm, oh

That's how strong my love is, baby
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is, darling
That's how strong my love is, again now

That's how strong my love is, so deep in
Well, that's how strong my love is
So much to love, yes so much of love, oh
Yes so much love, yes so much love
Anything that's hard to do, I would be good for you
Any kind of love you want, I'll be with you
