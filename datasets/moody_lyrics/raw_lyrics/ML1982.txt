Hardly waiting till the bed was warm
You close your eyes and said "I'm feeling torn"
How could I be so unindeemly forced into this chorus

I'm sad, I feel sad
For you, so sad
You'll be left alone, and broken bleeding
From the heart, when he doesn't come home

Softly sighs my nightingale
Another broken promise tips the scale and it goes pale
He seems shifting from side to side

Can't make up his god given mind, no
Why don't you just go if she's waiting

Whoa oh honey, you better think about it
