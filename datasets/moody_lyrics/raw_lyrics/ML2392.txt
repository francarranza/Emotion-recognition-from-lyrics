How could you 
You are the river 
Pour out of this life 

How could you 
You are the morning bird 
Who sang me into life every day 
Fly away 

You are the blood of me 
The harvest of my dreams 
There's nowhere I can find peace 
And the silence won't cease 

Nothing's quite how it seems 
The ghost of my joy 
Won't let me be 

If you set me free I will not run 
I will not run 
I will not run
