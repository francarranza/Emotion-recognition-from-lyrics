When the world is ready to fall
On your little shoulders
And when you're feeling lonely and small
You need somebody there to hold you

You can call out my name
When you're only lonely
Now don't you ever be ashamed
You're only lonely

When you need somebody around
On the nights that try you,
Remember, I was there when you were a queen
And I'll be the last one there beside you

So you can call out my name
When you're only lonely
Now don't you ever be ashamed
You're only lonely

(You're only lonely)
(You're only lonely)

Ooh, when the world is ready to fall
On your little shoulders
And when you're feeling lonely and small
You need somebody there to hold you

So don't you ever be ashamed (hold you)
When you're only lonely
Ah, you can call out my name
When you're only lonely

(You're only lonely) when you're only lonely...
(You're only lonely) ooh, it's no crime...
Darling, we've got lots of time, whoa

(You're only lonely) Whoa
Ah, there's nothing wrong with you
Darling, I get lonely, too.

(You're only lonely)
(You're only lonely)
So if you need me (You're only lonely)
All you got to do is call me
You're only lonely (You're only lonely)
(You're only lonely)
(You're only lonely)
