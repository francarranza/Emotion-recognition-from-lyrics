This happens every time of year
I don't know what to do
When I'm feelin' all cheery
And I wanna give a greeting
'Cause I'm in the holiday mood

And I go scrambling in my brain
Tryin' to guess what they celebrate
Then I give it all up and I cover my bases
And this is what I say, well I say

Like the other day
I was shovelin snow
And I saw my neighbor Akmed
He was stringin buddha beads
On his Christmas tree
With a yamaka on his head
He said "why don't you come by later
For the festival of lights.
Be here at 8, that's when we meditate".
I said "hell why not all right" and I say

Merry Krishne

Don't say I'm waterin religion down
I'm just including people all around
Isn't that what the whole deals about
Don't wanna leave nobody out
I don't care what you believe
On Hanukkah or Christmas Eve
Ramaddan and Kwanzaa too
I'm just trying to be nice to you

It's all colliding
What's a guy to do
Don't wanna go and offend anybody
Are they Christian, Muslim, Buddhist or Jew
You can't tell by looking
And it don't feel right to guess
Buyakasha, frickin kumbaya
It's all the same
God Bless
And I say

(Merry Krishne
