Until the philosophy
Which holds one race superior
And another inferior
Is finally and permanently
Discredited and abandoned
Everywhere is war

Until there is no longer first class
Or second class citizens of any nation
Until the color of a man? skin
Is of no more significance then
The color of his eyes
I've got to say "war"

That until the basic human rights
Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race
I'll say "war"

Until that day the dream of lasting peace
World-citizenship and the rule of
International morality will remain
Just a fleeting illusion to be pursued
But never obtained
And everywhere is war

Until the ignoble and unhappy regime
Which holds all of us through
Child-abuse, yeah, child-abuse yeah
Sub-human bondage has been toppled
Utterly destroyed
Everywhere is war

War in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south
There is war
And the rumors of war

Until that day
There is no continent
Which will know peace

Children, children

Fight!

We find it necessary
We know we will win
We have confidence in the victory
Of good over evil

Fight the real enemy!
