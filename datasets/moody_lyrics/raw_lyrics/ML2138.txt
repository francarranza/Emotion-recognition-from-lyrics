I saw him
He saw me
That Turin-stained shroud
In Rimini
He cried
And I cried
We both died
Laughing
Him and me
Why me?
Why Rimini?

I want you 
You want me
We both want
The things we'll never be now
We see now
It's sad how
Some things aren't meant to be
For we
Are just you and me
It never happens when you want it to
It never does what it's supposed to do
It's never good enough to see me through
See me through

I love that shroud that you're in
I love that you're maturing
I love that sweet sack you're in
I love your saccharin

I love that shroud that you're in
I love that you from Turin
I love that sweet sack you're in
I love your saccharin

It never happens when you want it to
It never does what it's supposed to do
It's never good enough to see me through
See me through

He saw me
I saw him
We both saw
Beneath each others'
Skin deep-
Er than deep
We both sleep
To dream of what could be
For me
And sing hymns for him and me

It never happens when you want it to
It never does what it's supposed to do
It's never good enough to see me through
See me through

I love that shroud that you're in
I love that you're from Turin
I love that sweet sack you're in
I love your saccharin

I love that shroud that you're in
I love that you're maturing
I love that sweet sack you're in
I love your saccharin
