It was gone before you ever had a chance
Lost forever in your disapproving glance

I see your face, it's twisted with shock
Falling from grace, you deserve what you got
The ice surrounds you now
You can pretend all that you want
I've seen the pain and all of the evil you brought

Quit your fucking crying and swallow all your pills
You're not the only one with the urge to kill
Grab the dusty bottle and let the liquor spill
Devoid of life, death is your final thrill

Bloodshot eyes can see right through the selfish lies
Search forever for a fix that keeps your high

I see your face, it's twisted with shock
Falling from grace, you deserve what you got
My hands around your throat
You can pretend all that you want
I've seen the pain and all of the evil you brought

I am the king of nothing, over emptiness I reign
Drown with sorrow, wash away the pain
I am the king of nothing, over emptiness I reign
Drown with sorrow, wash away the pain

I see your face, it's twisted with shock
Falling from grace, you deserve what you got
My hands around your throat
You can pretend all that you want
I've seen the pain and all of the evil you brought

I am the king of nothing, over emptiness I reign
Drown with sorrow, wash away the pain
I am the king of nothing, over emptiness I reign
Drown with sorrow, wash away the pain

Quit your fucking crying
Quit your fucking crying
Quit your fucking crying
Quit your fucking crying
