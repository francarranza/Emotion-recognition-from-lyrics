Blasting our way through the boundaries of Hell
No one can stop us tonight
We take on the world with hatred inside
Mayhem, the reason we fight

Surviving the slaughters and killings we've lost
Then we return from the dead
Attacking once more now with twice as much strength
We conquer then move on ahead

Evil, my words defy
Evil has no disguise
Evil will take your soul
Evil, my wrath unfolds

Satan our master in evil mayhem
Guides us with every first step
Our axes are growing with power and fury
Soon there'll be nothingness left

Midnight has come and the leathers strapped on
Evil is at our command
We clash with God's angels and conquer new souls
Consuming all that we can

Evil
Evil has no disguise
Evil will take your soul
Evil, my wrath unfolds
