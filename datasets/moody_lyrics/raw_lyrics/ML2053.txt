(I'll have a blue blue Christmas) 
I'll have a blue blue Christmas without you I'll be so blue thinking about you 
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree 
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me 
I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain 
And when those blue blue heartaches start hurtin' 
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white but I'll have a blue blue Christmas 
(I'll have a blue blue Christmas without you I'll be so blue thinking about you)
