I want to know how the story goes
And if the sad song writes about how much you know
About what really happened. Obviously
You've got a skewed view or you weren't present to see.

With a healthy dose of evident
Fabrication filling us in.
I want to know where you're coming from
And where you're going. Have you come undone?
There's a vitamin in this tune.
Step back a little bit. Give yourself room.

When you say, when you say how it used to be,
Understand I don't need the waste following me.
When you say, when you say how it used to be,
Understand I don't need the waste following me.
When you say, when you say how it used to be,
Understand I don't need the waste following me.

Winding it up.
Twist It. Undone.
Winding it up.
Twist It. Undone.

When you say, when you say
I want to know how the story goes
And if the sad song writes about how much you know
About what really happened. Obviously
You've got a skewed view or you weren't present to see.

With a healthy dose of evident
Fabrication filling us in.
I want to know where you're coming from
And where you're going. Have you come undone?
There's a vitamin in this tune.
Do yourself a favor. Give yourself room.

When you say, when you say how it used to be,
Understand I don't need the waste following me.
Aww!
When you say, when you say how it used to be,
Understand I don't need the waste following me.
When you say, when you say how it used to be,
Understand I don't need the waste following me.
Me!
