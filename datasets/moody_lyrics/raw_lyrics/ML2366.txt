She struts into the room, but I don't know her
But with a magnifying glance, I just sort of looked her over
We have a drink or two, well, maybe three
And then suddenly she starts telling me her life story

She says
Baby, if you wanna be my lover
You better take me home
'Cause it's a long, long way to paradise
And I'm still on my own

And I played guitar in a long-haired rock and roll band
She asked me why the singer's name was Alice
I said, "Listen, baby, you really wouldn't understand."

And I said
Baby, if you wanna be my lover
You better take me home
'Cause it's a long, long way to paradise
And I'm still on my own, on my own

Oh baby, if you wanna be my lover
You better take me home
'Cause it's a long, long way to paradise
And I'm still on my own
Oh
