If I were never to leave here
If I were always alone
If I were never to see you
If I could set the sun
If I could set the sun

Keep movin'
Keep changin'
Keep flowin' with the sun
Rivers rise
Oceans rise
People rise with the sun

If I were never to leave here
If I were always alone
If I would never to see you
If I could set the sun
If I could set the sun

Tears fallin'
Rain fallin'
Leaves are falling with the sun
Lives drifting
Seeds drifting
Worlds drifting with the sun

If I were never to leave here
If I were always alone
If I were never to see you
If I could set with the sunset, say it ...

If I
Never to leave here

If I
Always alone
If I

Oceans rise
Rivers rise
People rise 
With the sun

Oceans rise
Rivers rise
People rise 
With the sun
