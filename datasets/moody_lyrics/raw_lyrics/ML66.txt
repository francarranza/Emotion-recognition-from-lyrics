Away, I see it's going down
Today, hoping in time
We'll bury all this pain
And we'll awake something inside

We push our buttons far inside
We tear our hearts out
Then we fight

Hey, I know
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known
I cannot survive alone
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known

Our lives, were good in every way
Too late, time after time
Our love just turned to hate
But we stay by each other's side

We push our buttons far inside
We tear our hearts out
Then we fight

Hey, I know
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known
I cannot survive alone
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known

I keep holding on
I feel I'm where I belong

Every time we fight, it feels so wrong
I feel so enslaved by my pride
Then we meet again

We push our buttons far inside
We tear our hearts out
Then we fight

Hey, I know
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known
I cannot survive alone
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known
