I love you more
More than you know
Gonna let it show
I love you more, hey

You turned my mind
Inside and out
I can't hide it
One of a kind
There is no doubt
I can't fight it

Your point of view
In love
It's true
Seems you planned it
And when we touch
It's just enough
To understand it
Don't you know

I love you more
More than you know
Gonna let it show
I love you more, hey

I love you more
More than you know
Gonna let it show
I love you more, hey

Form the offset
The day we met
I knew I loved you
The stakes were set
I can't forget
What made me want you

Love's mysteries
Gave you and me
A new beginning
Now can't you see
How it can be
A happy ending
Don't you know

I love you more
More than you know
Gonna let it show
I love you more, hey

I love you more
More than you know
Gonna let it show
I love you more, hey

I love you more
More than you know
Gonna let it show
I love you more, hey

I love you more
More than you know
Gonna let it show
I love you more, hey

I love you more
More than you know
Gonna let it show
I love you more, hey

I love you more
More than you know
Gonna let it show
I love you more, hey

I love you more
More than you know
Gonna let it show
I love you more, hey
