I should've known you'd be this way
Serves me right, to fall in love

You brought me love then you took it back
We had it all and that's a fact
Love is a game that we all play
There's one thing I've got to say

I gave you my heart and I gave you my world
I spent those lonely nights right here in the cold
Every time you touch me, my body starts to quiver
All I want to do is love you all night long

Can't let you go my love
It's you that I need
You keep me wanting you
You push my love aside

Can't let you go my love
It's you that I need
You keep me wanting you
You push my love aside

I can't help but think of how you made me feel
Every time I think about the two of us

Can't realize (can't realize)
Can't seem to buy it (can't seem to buy it)
Now that you're gone (now that you're gone)
Now that you're gone

Can't let you go my love
It's you that I need
You keep me wanting you
You push my love aside

Can't let you go my love
It's you that I need
You keep me wanting you
You push my love aside

Can't let you go my love
You fit me like a glove
'Cause when you hold me tight
The feelings oh so right
Just can't forget those times
When you were mine, all mine
This love I have for you is true
So come back to the one who loves you

Every time you touch me, my body starts to quiver
All I want to do is love you all night long

I should've known that you'd be this way
Serves me right to fall in love
I can't help but think of how you left me feeling
Every time I think about the two of us

Can't realize (can't realize)
Can't seem to buy it (can't seem to buy it)
Now that you're gone (now that you're gone)
Now that you're gone

Can't let you go my love
It's you that I need
You keep me wanting you
You push my love aside

Can't let you go my love
It's you that I need
You keep me wanting you
You push my love aside

Can't let you go my love
It's you that I need
You keep me wanting you
You push my love aside

Can't let you go my love
It's you that I need
You keep me wanting you
You push my love aside

Can't let you go, let you go
I can't let you go

Can't let you go, let you go
I can't let you go
