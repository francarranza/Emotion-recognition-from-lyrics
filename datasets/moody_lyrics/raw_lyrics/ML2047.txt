Easy
Easy
Take love easy, easy easy
Never let your feelings show
Make it breezy, breezy breezy
Easy come and easy go

Never smile too brightly brightly
When your heart is riding high
Let your heart break, oh so slightly
When your baby says goodbye

That well known flame is mighty hot
As all of us have learned
So handle it with velvet gloves
And you won't get your fingers burned

Take love easy, easy
On the free and easy plan
And if you can't take it easy
Take it easy as you can

Take love easy, easy
Never let your feelings show
Make it breezy, breezy, easy
Easy, easy come and easy go

Never smile too brightly brightly
When your heart is riding high
Let your heart break, oh so slightly
When your baby says goodbye

That well known flame is mighty hot
As all of us have learned
So handle it, handle it with velvet gloves
And you won't get your fingers burned

Take love easy, easy easy
On the free and easy plan
And if you can't take it easy
Take it easy as you can

Take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy, take it easy, take it easy, take it easy
