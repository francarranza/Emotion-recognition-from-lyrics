When I was lost
I saw you pointing towards the sun
I know I am not the only one standing here
And in the darkness I was walking through the night
I could see your guiding light, very clear

This is your life
This is your moment
This is your life
This is your moment

When I was weak we both went walking on the sand
We were walking hand in hand it appeared
Once set our footprints when you carried me along
It was then that I abandoned my fears

This is your life
This is your moment
This is your life
This is your moment

This is your life
This is your moment
This is your life
This is your moment

This is your moment
This is your life
Your life
This is your time
