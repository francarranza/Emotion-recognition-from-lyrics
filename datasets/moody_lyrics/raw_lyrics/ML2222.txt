I'll have a blue Christmas
Without you
I'll be so blue
Thinking about you

Decorations of red
On a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same, dear
If you're not here with me

And when those blue
Snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue
Those blue memories start calling

Yeah!

Oh, you'll be doing alright
With your pretty, pretty Christmas in white
But I'm, I'm gonna have
A blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

Hey yeah!

Oh, you will be doing all right, doing alright
In your Christmas of white
But I'll, I'll have
A blue, blue Christmas
