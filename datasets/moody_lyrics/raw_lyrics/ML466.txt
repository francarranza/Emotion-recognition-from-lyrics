You say the sky is green
I don't know what you mean
Your lies were always clear but I don't mind
No, I don't mind, I don't mind

Go on and take everything from me and more
Go on and take everything from me and more

You say the sky is blue
As long as I'm with you
[Incomprehensible] but I don't mind
No, I don't mind, I don't mind

Go on and take everything from me and more
Go on and take everything from me and more
Go on and take everything from me and more

You have your reasons why
You've got them all in line
You think that I am blind but I don't mind
No, I don't mind, I don't mind

Go on and take everything from me and more
Go on and take everything from me and more
Go on and take everything from me and more

Go on and take everything from me and more
Go on and take everything from me and more
Go on and take everything from me and more
Go on and take everything from me and more
