I lift my voice 
I lift my praise to You 
I lift my hands 
I lift my worship to You 
And I love You more than I can say 
Oh I love You more than I can say 


Ever I will sing only You will I adore 
Glorify my Lord only You will I serve 
For the world will fade away 
Still my song to You remains 
Only You will I adore 


Oh I love You always 
Oh I love You always
