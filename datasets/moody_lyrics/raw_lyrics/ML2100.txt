Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

Home
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wing

Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?

Where did we lose the touch?
It seemed to mean so much
It always made me feel so

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

Home
Home and dry
Like a humming bird I'll fly
As a bird on wing

Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
It always made me feel so free

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

Free as a bird
Free as a bird
