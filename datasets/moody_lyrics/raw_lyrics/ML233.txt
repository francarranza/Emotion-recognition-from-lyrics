Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
  
Huh!
Huh!

I wanna kiss you
But if I do then I might miss you, babe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play
A love game, a love game

Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit 

Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? 
Dans the love game

Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? 
Dans the love game

Huh!
Huh!

I'm on a mission 
And it involves some heavy touching, yeah
You've indicated your interest
I'm educated in sex, yes
And now I want it bad, want it bad
A love game, a love game

Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit

Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Huh!

Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? 
Dans the love game

Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? 
Dans the love game

Huh!
Huh!

I can see you staring there from across the block
With a smile on your mouth and your hand on your... (huh!)
The story of us, it always starts the same
With a boy and a girl and a... (huh!) and a game 


A love game

Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? 
Dans the love game

Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? 
Dans the love game

Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? 
Dans the love game

Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?

Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
