It's gon' be trouble, trouble
It's gon' be trouble, trouble
It's gon' be trouble, trouble
It's gon' be trouble, trouble

Say man, she don't stop, she get it, get it, baby girl, the way she did it
Way she works her body makes a playa' wanna hit it
Did it up and down then she shook it all around
Shorty look at that and then she dropped it to the ground

Now I'm thinking I done found her panties roaming in the town
This girl was cuchie down, backside wasn't leaving ground
I was on it like a hound, got at her on the double
But been all up on her bubble, say man this girl is trouble

Baby girl, you know you're sexy the way you move you're body
Hope the music never stops, I like the way you wind
Don't pay me no attention, I'm just admiring that body
I'm enjoying my view strictly from behind

You're back, you're cold, you're good at what you do
Don't stop, it's working on the pole
You don't know what you 'bout to get into, do you, girl?
You better watch yourself

It's gon' be trouble, trouble
If she don't stop dancing on me like that, the way she pushing me back
I'm just saying it's gon' be trouble, trouble
If she get any closer I'ma have somethin' for her to grind on, grind on

Trouble, trouble
If she don't stop dancing on me like that, the way she pushing me back
I'm just saying it's gon' be trouble, trouble
If she get any closer I'ma have somethin' for her to grind on, grind on

Baby girl, you something else with the way you move yourself
If you wanna get closer baby, it's alright
I'd like to thank you shawty for coming to this party
'Cause I'm enjoying my view and baby I got you back

You're back, you're cold, you're good at what you do
Don't stop, it's working on the pole
You don't know what you 'bout to get into, do you girl?
You better watch it come

It's gon' be trouble, trouble
If she don't stop dancing on me like that, the way she pushing me back
I'm just saying it's gon' be trouble, trouble
If she get any closer I'ma have somethin' for her to grind on, grind on

Trouble, trouble
If she don't stop dancing on me like that, the way she pushing me back
I'm just saying it's gon' be trouble, trouble
If she get any closer I'ma have somethin' for her to grind on, grind on

Girl you gonna get it if you keep on doin' that
You must wanna get it
You better watch it girl 'cause it's gon' be trouble

It's gon' be trouble, trouble
If she don't stop dancing on me like that, the way she pushing me back
I'm just saying it's gon' be trouble, trouble
If she get any closer I'ma have somethin' for her to grind on, grind on

Trouble, trouble
If she don't stop dancing on me like that, the way she pushing me back
I'm just saying it's gon' be trouble, trouble
If she get any closer I'ma have somethin' for her to grind on, grind on
