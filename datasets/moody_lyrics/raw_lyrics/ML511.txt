I have found His grace is all complete
He supplies my every need
While I sit and learn at Jesus' feet
I am free indeed

What kind of joy is this?

It's joy unspeakable, all You've done for me
It's indescribable, just a taste of Your glory
It's unnatural, not to tell the story of all You've given me
My words are incomplete, it's joy unspeakable

I have found the pleasure I once craved
It's joy and peace within, within
What a wondrous blessing I am saved
From the awful gulf of sin

It's joy unspeakable, all You've done for me
It's indescribable, just a taste of Your glory
It's unnatural, not to tell the story of all You've given me
My words are incomplete

I have found the joy no tongue can tell
How its waves of glory roll
It is like an overflowing well
Springing up within my soul

It's unspeakable, all You've done for me
It's indescribable, just a taste of Your glory
It's unnatural, not to tell the story of all You've given me
My words are incomplete
It's joy unspeakable

Joy unspeakable
What kind of joy is this?
