"Let's get lost, lost in each other's arms
Let's get lost, let them send out alarms
And though they'll think us rather rude
Let's tell the world we're in that crazy mood.
Let's defrost in a romantic mist
Let's get crossed off everybody's list
To celebrate this night we found each other, mmm, let's get lost

(Horn solo) (piano solo)

Let's defrost in a romantic mist
Let's get crossed off everybody's list
To celebrate this night we found each other, mm, let's get lost
Oh oh, let's get lost"
