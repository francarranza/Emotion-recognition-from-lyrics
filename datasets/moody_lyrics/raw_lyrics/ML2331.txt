On assignment to the New World 
They said there'd be more chance for war 
Missed the shuttle to the main star 
They promised they'd be back for more, oh, yeah 
Then the warships came without a sound 
There were at least a hundred of them bearing down 

Caught in the crossfire 
Caught in a world insane, Lord 
War of the empire 
No-one will be the same, oh 
Caught in the crossfire 
Caught in a new age war, we were 

I heard somebody say we'd be wasted 
Under fire we were without defense 
My buddy said he had a space van 
A long range cruiser, it was our only chance, oh, yeah 
We could see no way out but one 
There was no choice but to try and run 

Caught in the crossfire 
Caught in a world insane, Lord 
War of the empire 
No-one will be the same, oh 
Caught in the crossfire 
Caught in a new age war, we were 

Odyssey, laser fight 
One shot, last fight 
Passed the warships through the neutral zone 
Our engines sheared the night as we raced for home 

Caught in the crossfire 
Caught in a world insane, Lord 
War of the empire 
No-one will be the same, oh 
Caught in the crossfire 
Caught in a new age war, we were 
Caught in the crossfire 
Caught in a new age war
