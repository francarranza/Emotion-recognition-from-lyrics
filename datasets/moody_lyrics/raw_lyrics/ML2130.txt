Feel the pressure, let it go
Feel the pressure, let it go

You try to buy some time
Can't read the signs or the reasons why
Every single time
Like you're drivin' blind
Can't make up my mind
I know I'm gonna find my way out

Crash
You're goin' down
Without a sound
Then I'll pass you up
Before I explode
Breakin' in two
I'll see it through
You won't keep me down
When I crash through you

So here we are right now
This is our time
So cross this line
Every single time
Like you're drivin' blind
Can't make up my mind
I know I'm gonna find my way out

Crash
You're goin' down
Without a sound
Then I'll pass you up
Before I explode
Breakin' into
I'll see it through
You won't keep me down
When I crash through you

I'll crash through you - you

Hear me out
I'm never backin' down
I'm never backin' down
Hear me out
I'm never backin' down
I know your goin' down

Crash
You're goin' down
Without a sound
Then I'll pass you up
I'm not gonna crash
And burn away
I'll rise today
You won't break me down
When I crash through you

Crash
You're goin' down
Without a sound
Then I'll pass you up
Before I explode
Breakin' into
I'll see it through
You won't keep me down
When I crash through you

I'll crash through you
I crash through you
I'll crash through you

Feel the pressure, let it go
Feel the pressure, let it go
Feel the pressure, let it go

Hear me out, I'm never backin' down
I'm never backin' down
