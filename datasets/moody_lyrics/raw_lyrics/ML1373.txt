The hatch is comin' open
OK, it's open
Verified
I'm movin' outside
OK I'm letting go
Copy that
I'm starting to drift away
It really is dark out here
How am I doin'?
You're doin' fine
I'm beginnin' to see a, er, point of light on the horizon
It's, er, gettin' larger
Erm, I'm gettin' some pretty good oscillations
Oh it's, it's, it's comin' quicker now
It's, er, it's really going

Any second now.

Here we go...

Eeer, wooh!

Heh heh

Hoo boy!
Heh

Oh that's tremendous
Well that, that, that's just er, beautiful
