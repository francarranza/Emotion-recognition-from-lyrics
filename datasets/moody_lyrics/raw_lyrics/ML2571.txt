Looking for a cure
Within the human race
Eliminate the poor
How much longer will it take?
Burning up the tents
Of the rank and file
Exterminate their lives
Crack a demon smile

Crushing down
Caving in
Our will to live
Getting rid
Of man's mistakes
To take a lost life
Lock it up, break it down, how much more can we take?

Fight for freedom
Fight authority
Fight for anything
My country 'tis of me

Cry for absolution
It's not the end for me
A last-minute pardon
One final reprieve
Resist the war machine
Don't get in its path
Fight to die a free man
And reap the aftermath

Crushing down
Caving in
Our will to live
Getting rid
Of man's mistakes
To take a lost life
Lock it up, break it down, I don't know how much more I can take

Fight for freedom
Fight authority
Fight for anything
My country 'tis of me



Fight for freedom
Fight authority
Fight for anything
It's my country
Fight for freedom
Fight authority
Fight for anything
My country 'tis of me
