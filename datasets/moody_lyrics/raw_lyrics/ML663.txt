This is for freedom
This is for those who care
I got my reason
No more in despair
We stand united
This is decided
The hand of fury
You're all invited

I crawl out of this nightmare
Out of the shadows
I walk into the devil's lair
My life
My path
Is where faith grows

'Cause I'm still alive
Feed the ﬁre inside
I'm
I'm still alive
The fuel
The ﬂame
Will ignite

This is the threshold
This is the quickening
No more rampage
In the battle ring
Fight for independence
For what you believe
The right to stand out
The glory to receive

I crawl out of this nightmare
Out of the shadows
I walk into the devil's lair
My life
My path
Is where faith grows

'Cause I'm still alive
Feed the ﬁre inside
I'm
I'm still alive
The fuel
The ﬂame
Will ignite

Take now what I've learned from
All these years of agony
And bring it
Take now
What I've learned from all these years of agony
And bring it to you

Bring it here tonight
