Yeah, you
Seem so civilized
Your mama's tryin'
To run your life
Your daddy's tryin'
To pick your wife
Oh no

Yeah, you run around
With all that hair
They just don't like
Those rags you wear
You say
I'm gonna pack up my stuff
I'm gonna run away

And then you say
You drive me nervous, nervous
And then I said
You drive me nervous, nervous, nervous, oh

Nervous, nervous, nervous, nervous, whoa-oh-oh
Ah

You're out of state
You're thrown in jail
You ain't got the bread
To pay the bail
Your mom and papa come up and said
"Honey, where did we fail?"

And then you scream
You drive me nervous, nervous
And then I screamed
You drive me nervous, nervous, nervous, oh

Nervous, nervous, nervous, nervous, whoa-oh-oh

You drive me ne-ne-ne-nervous
Ne-ne-ne-nervous
You drive me nervous
Whoa
