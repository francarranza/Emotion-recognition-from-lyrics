Silent night, holy night 
All is calm, all is bright 
Round yon virgin Mother and child 
Holy infant so tender and mild 
Sleep in heavenly peace 
Sleep in heavenly peace 

Silent night, holy night 
Shepherds quake at the sight 
Glories stream from heaven afar 
Heav'nly hosts sing Allelujah 

Christ the Savior is born 
Christ the Savior is born 
Sleep in heavenly peace
