This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together

Wake up in the morning, stumble on my life
Can't get no love without sacrifice
If anything should happen, I guess I wish you well
A little bit of heaven but a little bit of hell

This is the hardest story that I've ever told
No hope or love or glory
Happy ending's gone forever more
I feel as if I'm wastin'
And I'm wastin' everyday

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together

Two o'clock in the morning, something's on my mind
Can't get no rest, keep walkin' around
If I pretend that nothin' ever went wrong
I can get to my sleep, I can think that we just carried on

This is the hardest story that I've ever told
No hope or love or glory
Happy ending's gone forever more
I feel as if I'm wastin'
And I'm wastin' everyday

This is the way you left me (Oh, I feel as if I'm wastin')
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love (And I'm wastin' everyday)
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together

Little bit of love
Little bit of love
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love)
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love)
Little bit of love
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love)
Little bit of love
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love)
Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love)
Little bit of love, love, I feel as if I'm wastin'
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love)
And I'm wastin' everyday, hey, hey, hey
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love...)

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
To live the rest of our life
But not together

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
To live the rest of our life
But not together

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
