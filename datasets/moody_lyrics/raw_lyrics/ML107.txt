I saw you there standing under the mango tree,
Beautiful women you look so fine to me,
She had all the things that I've been searching for,
She had air blue hair, flower in her hair and longle shorts

She's my honey baby, my honey baby,
My honey baby, my honey baby

So that I want you to know,
That where ever you go,
I won't be far away,
Cause as I kiss your lips,
While you sway your hips,
You just hear me say

She's my honey baby, my honey baby,
My honey baby, my honey baby

(instrumental)

Said my sweet honey baby,
Yes you know I love you so,
So hold on tight,
And baby never let go,
Because you know that when you call on me,
I'll be there when I can,
And you can count on me,
'Cause I'm a Hawaiian superman

My honey baby, my honey baby,
My honey baby, my honey baby,

(instrumental)

Girl I just told you how I feel for you,
Every word I say yes you know its true,
Before I go there's just one more thing,
My darling,
If you thought it could mend me with this wedding ring

'Cause you're my honey baby, my honey baby,
My honey baby, my honey baby,
My honey baby, my honey baby

Yes I want you to know that you're mine,
All of the time,
Baby shine,
Honey baby you're mine,
Yes I want you to know that you're mine,
All of the time,
Baby shine,
Honey baby you're mine
