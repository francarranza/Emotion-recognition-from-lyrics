Angel, mmm, ooh
Angel, mmm, hmm
Angel, mmm, ooh, ooh, ooh
Angel, yeah (oh, oh)

Mmm, ba doo doo ba doo
Doo, ba, doo, doo
Doo, ooh (angel)

I found a certain paradise
Within my life with you
Heaven opened up its gates
And peace of mind
Came shining through

You smiled at me
When the world was unkind
I was finally able to unwind
I found an angel, yeah
An angel

I found an angel (angel)
You're an angel in my eyes (angel)
I found an angel (angel)
You're an angel in my eyes, yeah (angel)

The sun can rise and set with no regrets
I can forget all about my blues
My life can take direction now
And my mind a clearer point of view

You know you lift me up when I'm torn down
You brought me out of this lost and found
I found an angel, yeah
An angel

I found my-my-my-my-my angel (angel)
You're an angel in my eyes (angel)
I found an angel (angel)
Angel in my eyes, yeah (angel)

Angel
Ooh
Angel
Don't you know
Angel
Ooh
Angel, yeah
Yeah, ooh

(Angel) (Angel) (Angel) (Angel)
All I want, all I need
You gave me back my dignity
Angel (I found an angel)
You're all I want, all I need
You gave me back my dignity
Angel, hoo

My angel
My angel, yeah
Oh

My life can take direction now
My mind a clearer point of view
It's all because my baby
All because of you now, darlin'

Angel
Angel
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

My, my, my, my, my, my
My angel
Oh, oh (I found an angel)
Ooh, ooh
