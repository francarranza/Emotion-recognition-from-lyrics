Rise up!
Don't fall down again

Rise up
Long time I broke the chains

I try to fly a while so high
Direction - sky, oh!

My dream
Is to fly
Over the rainbow
So high

My dream
Is to fly
Over the rainbow
So high

My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow so high

I try to fly a while so high
Direction - sky

I try to fly a while so high
Direction - sky, oh!

My dream
Is to fly
Over the rainbow
So high

My dream
Is to fly
Over the rainbow
So high

My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high, oh!
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high, oh!
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high, oh!
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high, oh!

Rise up
Come falling down again

Rise up
Long time I broke the chains

I try to fly a while so high
Direction - sky

I try to fly a while so high
Direction - sky, oh!

My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high

Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up, will be the game!
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up, for my mind and my brain

'Cause
I try to fly a while so high
Direction - sky
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high, oh!
