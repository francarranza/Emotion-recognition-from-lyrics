I am a poor wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world alone
There is no sickness, toil nor danger
In that fair land to which I go

I'm goin' home to see my mother
I'm goin' home, no more to roam
I am just goin' over Jordan
I am just goin' over home

I know dark clouds will hover o'er me
I know my pathway is rough and steep
But golden fields lie out before me
Where weary eyes no more will weep

I'm goin' home to see my father
I'm goin' home, no more to roam
I am just goin' over Jordan
I am just goin' over home

I'll soon be free from every trial
This form shall rest beneath the sod
I'll drop the cross of self-denial
And enter in that home with God

I'm goin' home to see my Savior
I'm goin' home, no more to roam
I am just goin' over Jordan
I am just goin' over home
