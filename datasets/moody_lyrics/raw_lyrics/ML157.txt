Whenever I call you friend
I begin to think I understand
Anywhere we are
You and I have always been ever and ever

I see myself within your eyes
And that's all I need to show me why
Everything I do always takes me home to you
Ever and ever

Now I know my life has given me
More than memories
Day by day we can see
In every moment there's a reason to carry on

Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light
I've never seen such a beautiful sight
See love flowin' on us every night
I know forever we'll be doin' it

Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light
I've never seen such a beautiful sight
See love flowin' on us every night
I know forever we'll be doin' it right

Whenever I call you friend
I believe I've come to understand
Everywhere we are you and I were meant to be
Forever and ever

I think about the times to come
Knowin' I will be the lucky one
Ever our love will last
I always want to call you friend

Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light
Never seen such a beautiful sight
See love flowin' on us every night
I know forever we'll be doin' it

Now I know my life has given me
More than memories
Day by day we can see
In every moment there's a reason to carry on

Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light
Never seen such a beautiful sight
See love flowin' on us every night
I know forever we'll be doin' it doin' it

Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light
I never seen such a beautiful sight
See love flowin' on us every night
I know forever we'll be doin' it, doin' it, doin' it

Sweet love, sweet love, yeah
You're the glowing light in my life
So, so bright in my life
Oh, everything I do sends me back to you
Whenever I call you friend
