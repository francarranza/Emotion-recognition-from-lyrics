Natalie Wood gave her heart to James Dean
High school rebel and a beauty queen
Standing together in an angry world
One boy fighting for one girl

I want to be loved like that
I want to be loved like that
A promise, you can't take back
If you're gonna love me
I want to be loved like that

Daddy never gave momma a diamond ring
Momma never worried for anything
What he gave her came from the heart
A bond that was never torn apart

I want to be loved like that
I want to be loved like that
A promise, you can't take back
If you're gonna love me
I want to be loved like that

An old man kneeling all alone
Plants his flowers in a garden of stone
For seven years now she's been gone
And his devotion is still going strong

I want to be loved like that
I want to be loved like that
A promise, you can't take back
If you're gonna love me
I want to be loved like that
