Cheer up, lady
I'm really into it
Candor leaves us far behind
Let's see how twisted we can be
Soak up pleasantries
Mildew and stitchery
The needlepoint has set designs
To show how easy it can be

When we waste it on
We waste it on
We waste it on

Let's start making
Maps out of all the dead skin
That may be causing false alarms
It might be peeling much too quickly
Clean up with me
The homemade surgeries
My veneers sink into you
And show how twisted we can be

When we waste it on
We waste it on
We waste it on

On sullen meadows that will fit right in
With lisping rivers that will fit right in
With mountain ranges through matted lenses
That will fit right in, connect and dissect though we

With all your meadows they'll still see right in
With all your rivers they'll still see right in
No mountain ranges will stop them sensing
And they'll see right in and see right through 'cause we

We waste it on
We waste it on
We waste it on
We waste it on

We waste it on
We waste it on
We waste it on
