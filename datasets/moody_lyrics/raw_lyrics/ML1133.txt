Moon beams we can dream on, at the setting of the sun
And the stars we can wish upon, when the working man is done
Sunsets we could cry over, have our trouble's on the run
But more than these miracles above, good people, we need love
Everybody needs the love, love, love
Everybody needs the love, love, love
Everybody needs the love, love, love
Just like they need the sun and moon and stars up above.
And nobody ever found happiness, living their life all alone
I used to walk around like I didn't need nobody, to keep me happy and alone
And one fine day I found myself in trouble, way down without a friend
Along came the love of a real fine woman, said she'd love me 'til the end
Everybody needs the love, love, love
Everybody needs the love, love, love
Everybody needs the love, love, love,
Just like they need the sun and moon and stars up above.
Everybody, everybody needs love, love, love

Everybody, everybody needs love, love, love
Everybody, everybody needs love, love, love
Just like they need the sun and moon and stars up above.
Everybody needs the love, love, love
Everybody needs the love, love, love,
Everybody needs the love, love, love,
Just like they need the sun and moon and stars up above.
Everybody, everybody everybody needs love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love.
Love, love, love, love, love, love.
Everybody, everybody needs love, love, love
Everybody, everybody needs love, love, love
Everybody, Everybody needs love
