I didn't know you were a fake
Every lie straight to my face
So blind and I cannot see
Right behind my back you stab me
I should've known you were a bitch
Shut up you're making me sick
Little man you ain't nothing like me
Lying, cheating, so deceiving

I trusted you
Broke me down
And you screwed me over
Don't try to deny it
You cannot hide it
I've been ignited

When I get to watch you burn
Burn, burn
Now I wanna watch you burn
Burn, burn
Now I wanna watch you burn
You're gonna get what you deserve
I wanna watch you burn

You turned me inside out
My whole world is upside down
Now I know why your happy now
Looking over your shoulder
Your fucking me over

I trusted you
Sold me out
This is far from over
Don't try to deny it
You cannot hide it
I'll be ignited

When I get to watch you burn
Burn, burn
Now I wanna watch you burn
Burn, burn
Now I wanna watch you burn
You're gonna get what you deserve
You never learn

Your time has come now
It's your turn
I watch you burn

Burn, burn, burn
Now I wanna watch you burn
Burn, burn
Now I wanna watch you burn
You're gonna get what you deserve
You never learn

Your time has come now
It's your turn
Now I watch your burn

Burn, burn
Now I wanna watch you burn
Burn, burn
Now I wanna watch you burn
