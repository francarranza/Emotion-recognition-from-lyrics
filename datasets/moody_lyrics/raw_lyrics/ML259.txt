To all the travelers
Pilgrims longing for a home
From one who walks with you
On this journey called life's road
It is a long and winding road

From one who's seen the view
And dreamt of staying on the mountains high
And one who's cried like you
Wanting so much to lay down and die
I offer this, we must remember this

We are not home yet
We are not home yet
Keep on looking ahead
Let you heart not forget
We are not home yet
Not home yet

So close your eyes with me
And hear the Father saying, welcome home
Let us find the strength
In all His promises to carry on
He said, I go prepare a place for you
So let us not forget

We are not home yet
We are not home yet
Keep on looking ahead
Let you heart not forget
We are not home yet
We are not home yet
Keep on looking ahead
Let you heart not forget
We are not home yet

I know there'll be a moment
I know there'll be a place
Where we will see our Savior
And fall in His embrace
So let us not grow weary
Or too content to stay
'Cause we are not home yet
We are not home yet
Not home yet
So let us journey on

We are not home yet
We are not home yet
Keep on looking ahead
Let you heart not forget
We are not home yet
Not home yet
