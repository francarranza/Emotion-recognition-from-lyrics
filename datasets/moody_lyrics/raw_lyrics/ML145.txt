They like to get you in a compromising position
Well, they like to get you there and smile in your face
Yeah, they think they're so cute when they got you in that condition
But I think it's a total disgrace
And I say

I fight authority, Authority always wins
Well, I fight authority, Authority always wins
Well, I've been doing it since I was a young kid
And I come out grinnin'
Well, I fight authority, Authority always wins
(Oh yeah!)

I call up my preacher
I say, "Give me strength for round 5."
He said, "You don't need no strength, you need to grow up son."
I said, "Growin' up leads to growin' old and then to dyin',
Ooh, and dyin' to me don't sound like all that much fun."
And so I'll say

I fight authority, Authority always wins
Well, I fight authority, Authority always wins
Well, I've been doing it since I was a young kid
I come out grinnin'
Well, I fight authority, Authority always wins

I say: oh no, no no
I say: oh no, no no
I say: oh no, no no no
I fight authority, Authority always wins
I fight authority, Authority always wins (kick it in)
I've been doing it since I was a young kid
And I come out grinnin'
Well, I fight authority, Authority always wins

Well, I fight authority, Authority always wins
Well, I fight authority, Authority always wins
I've been doing it since I was a young kid
And I come out grinnin'
Well, I fight authority, Authority always wins

So I said,
I fight authority, authority always wins (Oh no)
Well I fight authority, authority always wins (Oh no no)
Well I've doing it since I was a young kid (Oh no)
And I come out grinnin' (Oh no)
Well I fight authority and authority always wins
