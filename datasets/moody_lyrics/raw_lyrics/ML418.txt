I rushed home from work like I always do
I spent my whole day just thinking of you
When I walked through the front door, my whole life was changed
'Cause nobody answered when I called your name

A note on the table that told me goodbye
Said you'd grown weary of living a lie
Oh, your love has ended, but mine still remains
But nobody answers when I call your name

Oh, the lonely sound of my voice calling
Is driving me insane
And just like rain, the tears keep falling
But nobody answers when I call your name

Oh, the lonely sound of my voice calling
Is driving me insane
And just like rain, the tears keep falling
But nobody answers when I call your name
Oh, nobody answers when I call your name
