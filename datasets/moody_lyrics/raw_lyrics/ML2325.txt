Disappearing out of sight
Along the open road
Into interstate horizons
I had no time to be loved

Like a silver bullet from a gun
An arrow from a bow
Like an equine star
You hear about me everywhere you go

All through nebulae
I was racing in my mind
I tripped on the light fantastic
And I've never looked behind

You slow down
You slow down
My lights are changing
You slow down
You slow down
Our lights are changing
You fly so high, yeah, and you move so fast
You're running blindly from the past
Slow down
You slow down
Green lights are changing

Oh, changing all the time
Oh, changing all the time

Looking through these hollow eyes
Across the great unknown
Growing greater every second
Growing harder with each stone
Yeah, and you who judge your freedom
By the quantity you stole
Would it make you any freer
If you took a little more?

All that summertime
I revolved around your eye
In accelerating spirals
In an asymmetric sky

You slow down
You slow down
Lights are changing
You slow down
You slow down
My lights are changing
Well, you slow down
You slow down
My lights are changing
