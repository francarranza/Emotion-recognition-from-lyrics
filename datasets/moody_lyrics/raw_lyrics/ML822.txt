Hear me spit
On you, wither I
Remold into gold
And bury I from sun

Reborn, left to sigh
Recur, maybe I'll
Be born and simplify
The way I lie, get bored

I get bored
I get bored
I get bored
I'm bored

Repent by you
And trust to figure out
I burn that gift to you, doll
And let it shine before

I get bored
I get bored
I get bored
A wish for a real one

Fit and confide
Before me or I
I will come clean, it gets worse
It's more

Get bored
I get bored
I get bored
A wish for a real one

Get bored
Get bored
Get bored
I wish for a real one
