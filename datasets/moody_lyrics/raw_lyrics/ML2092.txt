Without love, I am half human
Without love, I'm a machine
Without love, there's nothing doin'
I will die without love

Without love I am an island
All by myself in a heartbreak sea
Without love there's no denying
I am dying without iove

Oh there is nowhere I can run
And there is no hiding place
Sticking out iike a sore thumb
By the gloomy look
Upon my face

Without love l'm incomplete
Without love, I am not whole
Without love, l'm barely on my feet
I'm a dying without love

Oh there is nowhere I can run
And there is no hiding place
Sticking out like a sore thumb
By the gloomy look
Upon my face

Without love l'm incomplete
Without love, I am no whole
Without love, l'm barely on my feet
I am dying without love
I am dying without love
Oh yes I'm dying without love
