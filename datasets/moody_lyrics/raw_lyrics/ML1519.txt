Had a little love, but I spread it thin
Falling in her arms and out again
Made a bad name for my game around town
Tore out my heart and shut it down

Nothing to do, nowhere to be
A simple little kind of free
Nothing to do, no one but me
And that's all I need

I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely (yeah)
'Cause I don't belong to anyone
Nobody belongs to me

I see my friends around from time to time
When their ladies let 'em slip away
And when they ask me how I'm doing with mine
This is always what I say

Nothing to do, nowhere to be
A simple little kind of free
Nothing to do, no one to be
Isn't really hard to see

Why I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely (yeah)
'Cause I don't belong to anyone
Nobody belongs to me

And this is not to say
There never comes a day
I'll take my chances and start again
And when I look behind 
On all my younger times
I'll have to thank the wrongs that lead me to a love so strong

I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely (yeah)
'Cause I don't belong to anyone
Nobody belongs

That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it
