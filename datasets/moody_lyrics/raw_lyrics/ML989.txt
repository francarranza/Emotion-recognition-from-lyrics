Don't go around spreading rumours
Even if what you say is true
Before you go and tell your tales
You better think things true

So speak no evil, Evil won't happen to you

I've been mad enough to kill someone
But I couldn't face the task
So I tried to shout them down
With this big mouth of mine

So speak no evil, evil will get you in time

I've been about ..... that that shouldn't mess with you
Every time that I lied, you know I mean to tell the truth
No matter where I go , no matter what I do or say
Somebody gonna telling me, when they oughtta back away

Words thrown out in anger, always come back to haunt you
Once they go they told me, talk so hard to undo
So speak no evil, evil will come back to you
Better speak no evil, evil will come back to you
