She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
A mighty cyclone

Now look at that pepper on the back of that bumper
She ain't even playing when she's shaking that rumper
And oh, you ain't know she get lower than a muffler
Even with her girlfriends show stopping with a hustler

The way she move her body she might see the Maserati
She wanna put it on me tryna show me her tsunami
She make it hard to copy always tight and never sloppy
And got her entourage and her own paparazzi

Now there she go again riding through the stormy weather
You better button up if you wanna go get her
'Cause it is what it is, everybody wanna love her
But when she pop it, boy, you better run for cover

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
A mighty cyclone

(It's a wrap)
When she break them boys off a typhoon
(It's a wrap)
Gotta get that phatty like a boss tycoon

(It's a wrap)
Now hold it steady 'cause she make a monsoon
(It's a wrap)
Now you can Google, download the iTunes

See what I'm saying, she ain't playing
Yeah, she got them heads turning
You gon' hear it clack, clack
When them heels get to burning
Stiletto so fuego, she got her own label
And got us all doing the tornado

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
A mighty cyclone

Shawty got looks and shawty got class
Shawty got hips and shawty got ass
When she hit the stage she drop it down low like

Ay! This is crazy, it's amazing!
It must be the way of the lady

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
A mighty cyclone
