I'm free, I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality
I'm free, I'm free
An' I'm waiting for you to follow me

If I told you what it takes
To reach the highest high
You'd laugh and say "nothing's that simple"
But you've been told many times before
Messiah's pointed to the door
No one had the guts to leave the temple

I'm free, I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality

I'm free, I'm free
An' I'm waiting for you to follow me

How can we follow?
How can we follow?
