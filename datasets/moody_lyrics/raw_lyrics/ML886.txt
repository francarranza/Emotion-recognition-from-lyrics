Oppression is the holy law
In god I distrust
In time his monuments will fall
Like ashes to dust
Is war and greed the master plan?
The bible's where it all began
Its propaganda sells despair
And spreads the virus everywhere

Religion is hate
Religion is fear
Religion is war

Religion is rape
Religion's obscene
Religion's a whore

The pestilence is Jesus Christ
There never was a sacrifice
No man upon the crucifix
Beware the cult of purity
Infectious imbecility
I've made my choice
Six six six

(Solo - Hanneman)

Corruption breeds the pedophiles
Don't pray for the priest
Confession finds the lonely child
God preys on the weak
You think your soul needs to be saved
I think you're fucking miles away
Scream out loud here's where you begin
Forgive me father, for I have sinned

Religion is hate
Religion is fear
Religion is war

Religion is rape
Religion's obscene
Religion's a whore

The target's fucking Jesus Christ
I would've lead the sacrifice
And nailed him to the crucifix
Beware the cult of purity
Infectious imbecility
I've made my choice
Six six six

Jesus is pain
Jesus is gore
Jesus is the blood
That's spilled in war

He's everything
He's all things dead
He's pulling on the trigger
Pointed at your head

Through fear you're sold into the fraud
Revelation, revolution
I see through your Christ illusion

(Solo - King)

The war terror just drags along
My war with god is going strong
His propaganda sells despair
And spreads the violence everywhere

Religion is hate
Religion is fear
Religion is war

Religion is rape
Religion's obscene
Religion's a whore

There is no fucking Jesus Christ
There never was a sacrifice
No man upon a crucifix
Beware the cult of purity
Infectious imbecility
I've made my choice
Six six six
