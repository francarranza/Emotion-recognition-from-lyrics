Try and breathe some life into a letter
Losing hope, we'll never be together
My courage is at its peak
You know what I mean
How do you say you're okay
To an answering machine?
How do you say goodnight 
To an answering machine?

Big time's got its losers
Small town's got its vices
A handful of friends
One needs a match, one needs some ice
Call-waiting phone in another time zone
How do you say I miss you
To an answering machine?
How do say good night
To an answering machine?

(If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again
If you need help, dial the number...)

I get enough of that
                                        
Try to free a slave of ignorance
Try and teach a whore about romance

How do you say I miss you
To an answering machine?
How do you say good night to
An answering machine?
How do you say I'm lonely to
An answering machine?
The message is very plain
Oh, I hate your answering machine
I hate your answering machine
I hate your answering machine...

(If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again...
If you need help...)
