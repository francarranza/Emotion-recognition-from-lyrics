I love you because you understand, dear
Every single thing I try to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand, dear
I love you most of all because you're you

No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you

(I love you because the future's brighter)
(The door to happiness shall open wide)

No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
But most of all, I love you 'cause you're you
