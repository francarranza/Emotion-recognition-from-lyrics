Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year on, our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas
Make the Yule-tide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away

Oh, here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Are near to us once more

Someday soon we'll all be together if our fates allow, allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
Ooh, have yourself a Merry Little Christmas now

Merry, Merry Christmas
Merry, Merry Christmas
Merry, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you

To you, to you, to you
Merry, Merry Christmas
We're gonna make it through somehow

Merry, Merry Christmas
Thousand years

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Who'll be near to us once more

Through the years we'll all be together if our fates allow, allow, allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough, yeah, oh
So, so, have yourself Merry, Merry Christmas
Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas
Have yourself Merry, Merry Christmas
Have yourself a Merry, Merry Christmas
