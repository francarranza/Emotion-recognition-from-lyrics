What?

Stars can't fight city lights
They've turned their backs on us
It's true today, I saw it from the plane
Aeroplanes were never built to fly

Down down down down
Down down down down down down
Don't look down
Don't look now

Crosshairs of our shadow trace the dam
Told that there were people trapped alive
Boulder City looks like coals in the fire

Cabin's perched by satellites
And now it's flying down
We've got a lady pilot
She's not afraid to die

It's true today, I saw it from the plane
We've almost finished reeling in the sky
Power lines once laced the heavens
Pima County looks like coals in the fire
