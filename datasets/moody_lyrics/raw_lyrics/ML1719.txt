Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight
Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight
Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight with you

Where is Santa at his sleigh?
Tell me why is it always this way?
Where is Rudolph? Where is Blitzen, baby?
Merry Christmas, merry merry merry Christmas

All the children are tucked in their beds
Sugar-plum fairies dancing in their heads
Snowball fighting,
It's so exciting, baby

I love you and you love me
And that's the way it's got to be
I know it from the start
'Cause Christmas ain't the time for breaking each other's heart

Where is Santa at his sleigh?

Merry Christmas, merry merry merry Christmas

All the children are tucked in their beds Sugar-plum fairies dancing in their heads

I love you and you love me
And that's the way it's got to be

Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight
Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight
Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight with you
