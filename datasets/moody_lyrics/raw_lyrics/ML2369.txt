I used to be a fool
And think that life was cruel and full of hate
But now I see
Things are not so bad (things are not so bad)
If only I had had someone to hold my hand like you
I'd do it then

I'm so happy now
You changed my life somehow
I'm so happy now

And now that I am free
From all that misery and I can smile again
'Cause you
Came into my life (came into my life)
Said you'd be my wife and made me realize that life
Is wonderful

And
I'm so happy now
You changed my life somehow
I'm so happy now

I'm so happy now
You changed my life somehow
I'm so happy now

I'm so happy now
You changed my life somehow
I'm so happy now
