Locked knees, no keys
Brooklyn, Grand Street
Four flights, late nights
Black socks, white dice
Ten pounds, loud sounds
Turned up, tied & bound

Don't slow down

Don't slow down
Fire escapes sunny
Don't slow down
Butter and honey
Don't slow down
Iron and money
Don't slow down

Don't slow down
Pen vs pencil
Don't slow down
I don't make the rules
Don't slow down
Physical mental
Don't slow down

Don't slow down

Gardens and trashcans
Hoodies and chuck-t's
Arms fingers and hands
Don't slow down

Don't slow down
I'm feeling restless
Don't slow down
Summons and sentence
Don't slow down
We've made some messes
Don't slow down

Don't slow down
