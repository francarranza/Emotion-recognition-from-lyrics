I'm driving in my car, I turn on the radio
I'm pulling you close, you just say no
You say you don't like it but, girl, I know you're a liar
'Cause when we kiss, mmm, fire.

Late at night, I'm takin' you home
I whisper stay, you say you wanna be alone
You say you don't need me but, baby, I know you're a liar
'Cause when we kiss, mmm, fire, fire.

You had a hold on me right from the start
In a grip so tight I can't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin' actin' like a fool
Your kisses they burn but your heart stays cool.

Romeo and Juliet, Samson and Delilah
You can bet their love, they didn't deny
Your words say split but your words they lie
When we kiss, oh, fire, fire.

You had a hold on me right from the start

Romeo and Juliet, Samson and Delilah
You can bet their love, they didn't deny
Your words say split but your words they lie
When we kiss, oh, fire, fire, fire, fire ...
