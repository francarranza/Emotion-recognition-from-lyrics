O they tell me of a home far beyond the skies
And they tell me of a home far away
O they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
O they tell me of an uncloudy day

O the land of cloudless day
O the land of an unclouded sky
O they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
O they tell me of an uncloudy day

O they tell me of a home where my friends have gone
And they tell me of that land far away
Where the tree of life in eternal bloom
Sheds its fragrance through the uncloudy day

O the land of cloudless day
O the land of an unclouded sky
O they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
O they tell me of an uncloudy day

O they tell me of a King in His beauty there
And they tell me that mine eyes shall behold
Where He sits on the throne that is whiter than snow
In the city that is made of gold

O the land of cloudless day
O the land of an unclouded sky
O they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
O they tell me of an uncloudy day

O they tell me that He smiles on His children there
And His smile drives their sorrows all away
And they tell me that no tears ever come again
In that lovely land of uncloudy day

O the land of cloudless day
O the land of an unclouded sky
O they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
O they tell me of an uncloudy day
