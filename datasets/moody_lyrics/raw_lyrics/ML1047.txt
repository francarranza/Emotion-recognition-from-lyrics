I lost at love before 
Got mad and closed the door 
But you said child just once more 

I chose you for the one 
Now we're havin' so much fun 
You treated me so kind 
I'm about to lose my mind 

You made me so very happy 
I'm so glad you 
Came into my life 

The others were untrue 
But when it came to lovin' you 
I'd spend my whole life with you 

'Cause you came and you took control 
You touch my very soul 
You always show me that 
Lovin' you is where it's at 

You made me so very happy 
I'm so glad you 
Came into my life 

Thank you, baby

I love you so much you see
You're even in my dreams 
I can hear
Baby, I can hear you calling me
I'm so in love with you 
All I ever want to do is 
Thank you baby, thank you baby 

You made me so very happy 
I'm so glad you
Came into my life 

You made me so very happy 
You made me so, so very happy
I'm so glad you
Came into my life

Mmmm, I want to thank you, girl
Every day of my life
I wanna thank you 
You made me so very happy 
Oh, I wanna spend my life thanking you 
Thank you baby, thank you baby
Thank you baby thank you baby
