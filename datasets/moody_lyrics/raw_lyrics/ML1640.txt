Where are you Christmas?
Why can't I find you?
Why have you gone away?
Where is the laughter
You used to bring me?
Why can't I hear music play?

My world is changing
I'm rearranging
Does that mean Christmas changes, too?

Where are you Christmas?
Do you remember
The one you used to know?
I'm not the same one
See what the time's done
Is that why you have let me go?

Christmas is here everywhere, oh
Christmas is here If you care, oh
If there is love in your heart and your mind
You will feel like Christmas all the time, oh

I feel you Christmas
I know I've found you
You'll never fade away, oh
The joy of Christmas
Stays here inside us
Fills each and every heart
With love

Where are you Christmas?
Fill your heart with love 
Mmhmm
