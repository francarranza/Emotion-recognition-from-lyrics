Sometimes they rock and roll
Sometimes they stay at home and it's just fine
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire

I held my mother's hand
And left the body in the bed all day
We don't know what to do
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire

A thousand made-up loves
What makes the sound of surf once you know you're alive?
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire

It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire

And you're my favourite thing
Tell it everywhere I go
I don't know what to do
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire

Sometimes they rock and roll
I'd rather stay at home in real life
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire

It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time

This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
This heart's on fire
