Hey little girl
Why you fooling around
Why you always gotta be puttin' me down
U don't know what I'm talking about
So hey little girl better stop putting out

I've been walking in my sleep
Can you give me what I need

It's never enough just to hold you
It's never enough just to please you
Ooh baby it's never enough
You take and you take all you can
Now I need to understand
It's never enough
Baby bye bye

Hey little girl you're a heartbreaker
Why you gotta be such a dictator
U don't care about how I feel
Why you always gotta be spinning your wheels

I've been walking in my sleep
Can you give me what I need

It's never enough just to hold you
It's never enough just to please you
Ooh baby it's never enough
You take and you take all you can
Now I need to understand
It's never enough
Baby bye bye
