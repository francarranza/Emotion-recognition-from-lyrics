I'll let you in on how I'm feeling
You've got alot of nerve 
You'll get what you deserve
Granted this feeling's unappealing
I'm bitter I'll admit
Now I've gotta deal with it

Just one more thing, ok 
It's all so sad to say
It's so sad to say 
What we had has gone away
You could say it's sad
Think of what we could have had

I'll let you out without resistance
Parting this way is not the way we ever thought
(In fact) I always thought we'd go the distance
But we went nowhere quick, so sad it makes me sick

Just one more thing, ok 
It's all so sad to say
It's so sad to say 
What we had has gone away
You could say it's sad
Think of what we could have had

My anomosity has got the best of me
It's been feeding off a sadness deep inside me that'll fade I pray
And in time what will I know
It's so far, it's fading slow
Just one more thing, ok 
It's all so sad to say

It's so sad to say 
What we had has gone away
You could say it's sad
Think of what we could have had

So sad to say!
So sad to say!
