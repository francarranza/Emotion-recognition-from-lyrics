(Craig Armstrong) 

This love
This love is a strange love
In that it can lift a love
This love
This love
I think I'm gonna fall again
And even when you held my hand
Intending me to face, love
This love
Now rehearsed we stay, love
Doesn't know it is love
This love
This love
Doesn't have to feel love
Doesn't care to be love
It doesn't mean a thing
This love
This love loves love
It's a strange love, strange love
This love
This love
This love is a strange love, strange love
I'm gonna fall again love
Doesn't mean a thing
Think I'm gonna fall again
This Love
