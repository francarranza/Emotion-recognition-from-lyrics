Well I've heard lots of people say 
They're gonna settle down 
You don't see their faces 
And they don't come around 
Well I'm not that way 
I got to move along 

I like to drink and to dance all night 
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight 
You got that right 
Said, you got that right 
Sure got that right 

Seems so long I been out on my own 
Travel light and I'm always alone 
Guess I was born with a travellin' bone 
When my times up, I'll hold my own 
You won't find me in an old folks home 
You got that right 
Well you got that right 
Said, you got that right 
Sure got that right 
I tried everything in my life 
Things I like I try 'em twice 
You got that right 
Sure got that right 

Travellin' around the world, just singing my song 
I got to go, Lord I can't stay long 
Here comes that ol' travellin' jones once again 
I like to drink and to dance all night 
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight 
You got that right 
Said, you got that right 
Well you got that right 
Sure got that right
