Go!
Forever falling, Into oblivion
The darkness crawls forward
It engulfs, my will to live
Fear is failure
And this is my motivation

Take back what was stolen
Reclaim all that's lost
With virtue, I will rise up from the ruins

C'mon!
Through adversity, there is redemption
With passion, fighting
I am unbroken
Through adversity, there is redemption
With passion, fighting
I am, unbroken!

Take back what was stolen
Embrace the cycle
Refuse to turn back now and be led astray
Fear is failure
And this is my affirmation

Through adversity, there is redemption
With passion, fighting
I am unbroken
Through adversity, there is redemption
With passion, fighting
Unbroken!

The absence of fear, is the renewal of self
The absence of doubt, breeds desire
If there is truth to face
I will design it
I will not be denied!
