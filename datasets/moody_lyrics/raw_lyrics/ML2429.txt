I want to have a party
I want to have a party
I want to have a party
I want to have a party
You cannot kill the party
You cannot kill the party
You cannot kill the party
Long live the party

I want to have a party
I want to have a party
I want to have a party
I want to have a party
You cannot kill the party
Cannot kill the party
Cannot kill the party
Cannot kill the party
Long live the party

Do you care what you are?
Where's your pride?

We don't know but we don't wonder why

I want to have a party
I want to have a party
I want to have a party
I want to have a party
You cannot kill the party
You cannot kill the party
You cannot kill the party
Long live the party

I want to have a party
I want to have a party
I want to have a party
I want to have a party
You cannot kill the party
You cannot kill the party
You cannot kill the party
Long live the party

The conquest will survive

The more that you can give it then the more it will be
And if you do not have it you can take it from me
All we ever wanted was a thing to believe
And now that we found it we have all that we need

The more that you can give it then the more it will be
And if you do not have it you can take it from me
All we ever wanted was a thing to believe
And now that we found it we have all that we need
All that we need

We have found our pride
