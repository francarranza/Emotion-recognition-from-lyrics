Wonderful, so wonderful
Is Your unfailing love
Your cross has spoken mercy over me
No eye has seen no ear has heard
No heart can fully know
How glorious, how beautiful You are

Beautiful One I love You
Beautiful One I adore
Beautiful One my soul must sing

Powerful so powerful
Your glory fills the skies
Your mighty works displayed for all to see
The beauty of Your majesty
Awakes my heart to sing
How marvelous how wonderful You are

Beautiful One I love You
Beautiful One I adore
Beautiful One my soul must sing

Beautiful One I love You
Beautiful One I adore
Beautiful One my soul must sing

You opened my eyes to wonders anew
You captured my heart with this love
Because nothing on Earth is as beautiful as You

Jesus

You opened my eyes to wonders anew
You captured my heart with this love
Because nothing on Earth is as beautiful as You

Beautiful One I love You
Beautiful One I adore
Beautiful One my soul must sing

Beautiful One I love You
Beautiful One I adore
Beautiful One my soul must sing

And You opened my eyes to wonders anew
You captured my heart with this love
Because nothing on Earth is as beautiful as You
