You're a thousand miles away-ay
Bu-you-t I still have your love to remember you by
Oh, my dar-are-are-arling, dry your eyes
Daddy's coming home soon

On my knees every day-ay
All I do is pray, baby, just for you
Hope you a-a-a-always want me too
Daddy's coming home soon

It may be on a Sunday morning
It may be on a Tuesday afternoon
But no matter what the day is
I'm going to make it my business to get home soon

You're (a thousand miles away)
Bu-you-ut I still have your love to remember you by
Oh, my dar-are-are-arling, dry your eyes
Daddy's coming ho-ome so-ooh-ooh-ooh-oon
