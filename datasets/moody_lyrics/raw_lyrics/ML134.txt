Gimme a beat!

Sittin' in the movie show
Thinkin' nasty thoughts
Better be a gentleman
Or you'll turn me off, huh
That's right, lemme tell it

Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing, huh
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change, huh
Oh you nasty boys

I don't like no nasty car
I don't like nasty food 
The only nasty thing I like
Is a nasty groove, huh
Will this one do? Uh-huh, I know, ssay

Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing, huh
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change, huh
Oh you nasty boys

Nasty, nasty boys, gimme a nasty groove, huh
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, lemme see your nasty body move, huh
Oh you nasty boys

I could learn to like this
Listen up

I'm not a prude, I just want some respect 
So close the door if you want me to respond
'Cause Privacy is my middle name
My last name is Control
No, my first name ain't baby
It's Janet... Ms. Jackson if you're nasty

Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change, huh
Oh you nasty boys

Nasty boys don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys don't mean a thing to me, uh
Nasty, don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys, uh

I like this part

Hey!
Who's that thinkin' nasty thoughts? 
Who's that in that nasty car? 
Who's that eatin' that nasty fruit? 
Who's jammin' to my nasty groove? 

Ladies?
Nasty boys don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys
