You say it's 'cause you're dreaming
Of how good it's going to be

'Cause I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do
But I don't have the heart to love you
Not the way you want me to

You're so trusting and open
Hoping that love will start
But I don't have the heart, oh no
I don't have the heart

I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do
But I don't have the heart to love you
Not the way that you want me to

 Ooh
Baby, I don't have
