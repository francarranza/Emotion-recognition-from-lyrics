Come, let's stroll
Stroll across the floor
Come, let's stroll
Stroll across the floor
Now turn around, baby
Let's stroll once more

Feel so good
Take me by my hand
I feel so good
Take me by my hand
And let's go strolling
In wonderland

Strollin', oh yeah
Strollin', rollin', strollin'
Well, rock my soul
How I love to stroll

There's my love
Strollin' in the door
There's my love
Strollin' in the door
Baby, let's go strollin'
By the candy store
