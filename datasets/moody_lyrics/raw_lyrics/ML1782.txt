When the evenin' sun goes down
You gonna find me hangin' 'round
The night life ain't no good life
But it's my life

Many people just like me
Dreamin' of what used-to-be's
Oh, the night life, it ain't no good life
But it's my life

Listen to the blues they're playin'
Listen what the blues are sayin'

Mine is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams
The night life ain't no good life
But it's my life

Listen to the blues they're playin'
Listen what the blues are sayin'

Mine is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams
And The night life ain't no good life
But it's my life

The night life it ain't no good life
But it's my life
