Why let this world
Just weigh on your shoulders
Pick it up, push it off
Before you let yourself get colder

Just look into the eyes
The good eyes of a child
See that love
Rise like a river
And flow for a thousand miles

Give me some peace, love, happiness
Peace, love, happiness
Peace, love, happiness
Peace, love, happiness

Come on, give it to me

Breathe in deep
Feel your heart beat
Just to know that life's worth living
Feel your feet
On the earth
You better love it
While it's still here spinning

I've got no time to worry
About troubles or misgivings
Need to let it flow
Let yourself go
'Cause if you're hating then you sure ain't living

Give me some peace, love, happiness
Peace, love, happiness
Peace, love, happiness

Come on, give it to me

Look'it here
Lot of people talking
We need somebody to listen
Lot of people strugglin'
If you got think you better start givin'

Peace, love, happiness
Peace, love, happiness
Peace, love, happiness
Come on now

C'mon give it to me
You've got to give it up

I can not eat this daily bread
With so many people starving
How come the presidents' build more bombs
When nations start disarming
With all that money spent on guns
Instead of food and education
Need to buy a little piece at the end of this day
Start the healing of the nation

Give some peace, love, happiness
Peace, love, happiness...
