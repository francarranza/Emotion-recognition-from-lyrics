Here we go
 
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same, dear, if you're not here with me
 
And when the blue snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue memories start callin'
You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas, alright
 
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
(Blue Christmas, blue, blue Christmas)
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
(Blue Christmas, blue, blue Christmas)
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Well, they won't be the same, dear, if you're not here with me
 
And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
(Blue Christmas, blue, blue Christmas)
That's when those blue memories start callin'
(Blue Christmas, blue, blue Christmas)
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
 
Baby, I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
Oh, so very blue
