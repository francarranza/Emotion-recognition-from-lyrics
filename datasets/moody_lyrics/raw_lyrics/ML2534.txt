Oh
Baby, don't you want to go
Oh
Baby, don't you want to go
Back to the land of California
To my sweet home Chicago

Oh
Baby, don't you want to go
Oh
Baby, don't you want to go
Back to the land of California
To my sweet home Chicago

Now one and one is two
Two and two is four
I'm heavy loaded baby
I'm booked, I gotta go
Cryin', baby
Honey, don't you want to go
Back to the land of California
To my sweet home Chicago

Now two and two is four
Four and two is six
You gon' keep on monkeyin' 'round here friend-boy,
You gon' get your
Business all in a trick
But I'm cryin', baby
Honey, don't you want to go
Back to the land of California
To my sweet home Chicago

Now six and two is eight
Eight and two is ten
Friend-boy, she trick you one time
She sure gon' do it again
But I'm cryin', baby
Honey, don't you want to go
Back to the land of California
To my sweet home Chicago

I'm goin' to California
From there to Des Moines, Iowa
Somebody will tell me that you 
Need my help someday, cryin'
Hey, hey
Baby, don't you want to go
Back to the land of California
To my sweet home Chicago
