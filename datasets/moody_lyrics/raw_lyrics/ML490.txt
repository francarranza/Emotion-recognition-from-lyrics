<Joy, joy, joy, sweet joy
Joy, joy, down in my soul
Sweet beautiful soul saving joy
Oh joy, joy in my soul

Listen to the music
The sound of the angels
Come and see the child
Who can make you hope
Lying in a manger
Away from harm and danger

Oh joy, joy in my soul
Oh joy, joy in my soul
Joy, joy, joy, sweet joy
Joy, joy, down in my soul
Sweet beautiful soul saving joy
Oh joy, joy in my soul

He sent from up above
This special gift of love
More precious than silver or gold
He was sent this holy day
To take our pain away

Oh joy, joy in my soul
Oh joy, joy in my soul

Go tell it on the mountain
Shout it from a valley
Tell about the baby in swaddling clothes
Men in every nation
Join the celebration

Oh joy, joy in my soul
Oh joy, joy in my soul

Whitney ad lib:
Way down deep inside my soul, joy
Joy, joy, joy
I've got joy
Said that way down deep joy
Joy, joy, joy
I've got joy
We've got deep joy
Unspeakable joy
In my soul >
