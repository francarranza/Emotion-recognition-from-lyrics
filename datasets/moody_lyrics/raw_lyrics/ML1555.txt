Soon time for a cleaning day
Onward rode the van
Swept in by discolored waste
Sickness crept on the hall
And the death of me
Almost as we burn and play
Ants just don't belong
In this place you call your own

Searching for a favorite flower
Narrow with the hall
Swept in by discolored waste
Almost as we burn and play
Ants just don't belong
In this place you call your own
Danger's taller trees
Don't look so good to me
They won't grow again
Led to final peace
And this diluted stream
They don't break for them
