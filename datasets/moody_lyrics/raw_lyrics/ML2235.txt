Doctor, doctor, I'm in bed
Doctor, doctor, aching head
Doctor, doctor, gold is lead
Doctor, doctor, choke on bread

Doctor, doctor, underfed
Doctor, doctor, gold is lead
Doctor, doctor, Jesus bled
Doctor, doctor, pain is red

Doctor, doctor, dark doom
Gruel ghoul, greasy spoon
Used spool, June gloom





Music seems to help the pain
Seems to motivate the brain
Doctor, kindly tell your wife
That I'm alive, flowers thrive
Realise, realise
Realise
