I don't know, I don't know
Where I'll go or what I'll do
It makes no difference what I do without you

Oh I love you, My darlin'
But I'll try and let you leave
Goodbye it's the last you'll hear of me

Well I found a blue bird high on a mountain side
And the little bird would sing its little song

So I'll sigh, I'll cry, I'd even wanna die
For the one I love is gone

Well I found a blue bird high on a mountain side
And the little bird would sing its little song
So I'll sigh, I'll cry, I'd even wanna die
For the one I love has gone
