(Never my love, never my love)

You ask me if there'll come a time
When I'll grow tired of you
Never my love
(Never my love, never my love)
Never
(Never my love, never my love)

You wonder if this heart of mine
Will lose its desire for you
Never my love
(Never my love, never my love)
Never my love
(Never my love, never my love)

What makes you think love will end
When you know that my whole life depends
On you, on you

Never my love
Never my love

You say you fear I'm gonna change my mind
And I won't require you
Never my love
(Never my love, never my love)
Never, never, never

(Never my love, never my love)

Tell me, how can you think love will end
When I've asked you to spend your whole life
With me, with me

You ask me if there'll come a time
When I'll grow tired of you
Never my love
(Never my love, never my love)
Never my love
(Never my love, never my love)
Never my love
(Never my love, never my love)
(Never my love, never my love)

(Never my love, never my love)
Never, never, never
(Never my love, never my love)
Never, never, never, no, no, no
(Never my love, never my love)
My love, never my love
(Never my love, never my love...)
