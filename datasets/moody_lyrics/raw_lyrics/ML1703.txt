Still by the window pane
Pain like the rain that's falling
She waits in the air
Matte kudasai
She sleeps in a chair
In her sad America

When, when was the night so long
Long like the notes I'm sending
She waits in the air
Matte kudasai
She sleeps in a chair
In her sad America

She waits in the air
Matte kudasai
She sleeps in a chair
In her sad America
