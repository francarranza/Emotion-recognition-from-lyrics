I don't understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to

What I'm trying to say is that I love you, I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to
Let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

It's gonna burn for me to say this
It's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart

Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways

Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it been through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here but I want you
'Cause the feelin ain't the same find myself
Callin' her your name

Ladies tell me do you understand?
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake
Now it's too late
I know she ain't comin back

What I gotta do now to get my shorty back
Ooo ooo ooo ooooh
Man I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without my boo

You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours
I'mma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)

When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go
'Cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it been through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me
That I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry, ooh
I'm twisted cuz one side of me
Is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry, yeah

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh oooh can ya feel me burnin'?
Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' till you return

When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go
'Cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it been through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
