I've got a bad case of turnin' it up
It's gettin' cold in here, so fire it up
I've got a bad case of turnin' it up
It's gettin' cold in here, so somebody, fire it up

Come on and fire it up

I'm in love with the feeling of pressure to the ceiling
Wake up with intention to face my opposition
Get raw when it's time to lay it on the line
To the wall's where we're taking it
Let your light shine, like

Let your light shine, like
Let your light shine

I've got a bad case of turnin' it up
It's gettin' cold in here, so fire it up
I've got a bad case of turnin' it up
It's gettin' cold in here, so somebody, fire it up

Come on and fire it up

Take it higher, take it higher, 'til the roof is on fire
Take it higher, take it higher, let's burn it up
Take it higher, take it higher, 'til the roof is on fire
Take it higher, take it higher, let's burn it up

We throw down when it's time for the action, make it happen
And the sound got you feelin' like "man, what just happened?"
When it's on, you might not get a warning or a sign
To the wall's where we're taking it
Let your light shine, like

Let your light shine, like
Let your light shine

I've got a bad case of turnin' it up
It's gettin' cold in here, so fire it up
I've got a bad case of turnin' it up
It's gettin' cold in here, so somebody, fire it up

Come on and fire it up
Come on and fire it up
Come on and fire it up
