I remember long ago
How I wondered where I'd go
While the blizzards, cold wind and snow
Pounded outside my window.

California sunset
Going down in the West
All the colors in the sky
Kiss another day goodbye.

Land of beauty, space and light
Land of promise, land of might
You're my home now and it's true
California, here's to you.

California sunset
Going down in the West
All the colors in the sky
Kiss another day goodbye.

California sunset
Going down in the West
All the colors in the sky
Kiss another day goodbye.

The golden state!
