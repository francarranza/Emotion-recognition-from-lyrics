I feel a burning, deep inside of me
I feel your Spirit, it's moving around me
I hear Your voice, You're calling me closer
I know that You're here, You're calling me closer
And I will...

Love You with all of my heart
Jesus I'll love You with all of my mind
Jesus I'll love You with all of my soul
Jesus I'll love You with all that I am

I know that You hear me when I say my prayers
I know that You're with me even when I'm all alone
When I close my eyes, You're calling me close
When I pull away, You're pulling me closer
And I will...

Love You with all of my heart
Jesus I'll love You with all of my mind
Jesus I'll love You with all of my souls
Jesus I'll love You with all that I am

You are holy, Lord God Almighty
You are holy, Lord God Almighty
Who was and is and will soon come again
Lord you are and now You're coming again
Just like you said, You're coming again
And I will...

Love You with all of my heart
Jesus I'll love You with all of my mind
Jesus I'll love You with all of my souls
Jesus I'll love You with all that I am
Jesus I'll love You with all that I am
Jesus I'll love You with all that I am
