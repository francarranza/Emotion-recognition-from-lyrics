Go jump in the lake, go ride up the hill
Get out of this house
It's a house of your making, it's a house of ill will
Get out of this house

Go listen to Buddha, go listen to Joe
Get out of this house
If anyone asks, you tell them you don't know
Get out of this house

I spent 11 long years in a hothouse zone
I spent 29 more trying to get home
Well, I never got home, but I did what I did
And I got myself this house, and you can't come in, oh

Yeah
Get out of this house
Get out of this house

I'm the queen of my castle, I'm the king of my room
Get out, get out of this house
I got more than I need, more than I ever could use
Get out, get out of this house

I spent 17 years trying to save my soul
I spent 23 more down in the hole
Now my soul is all right, but I might get found out
And I got myself this house now, and I can't get ou-out

Get out of this house
Get out of this house

If I see you again, it will be in my head at the end of a cloud
If you see me again, it will be in your head telling you to get out

You act like a baby, you talk like a fool
Get out of this house
Go back to your mama, go back to high school
Get out of this house

Go jump in the lake, go jump out the door
Get out, get out of this house
I've had all I can stand, and I can't stand no more
Get out, get out of this house
Get out of this house
