Watch out (You might get what you're after)
Cool babies (Strange but not a stranger)
I'm an ordinary guy
Burning down the house

Hold tight (Wait till the party's over)
Hold tight (We're in for nasty weather)
There has got to be a way
Burning down the house

Here's your ticket pack your bag
Time for jumpin' overboard
Transportation is here
Close enough but not too far
Maybe you know where you are
Fightin' fire with fire

All wet (Hey, you might need a raincoat)
Shape down (Dreams walking in broad daylight)
Three hundred sixty five degrees
Burning down the house

It was once upon a place
Sometimes I listen to myself
Gonna come in first place
People on their way to work say
"Baby, what did you expect?"
Gonna burst into flame

Burning down the house

My house (S'out of the ordinary)
That's right (Don't want to hurt nobody)
Some things sure can knock me off my feet
Burning down the house

No visible means of support
And you have not seen nothing yet
Everything's stuck together
I don't know what you expect staring into the TV set
Fighting fire with fire
Fighting fire with fire
Fighting fire with fire
Fighting fire with fire
Fighting fire with fire

Burning down the house
