I got that fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire for the dance floor
I got that fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire for the dance floor

Turn it up
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire on the dance floor
I got that fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire on the dance floor

Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up

Turn it up-up
Turn it up-up
Turn it up-up
Turn it up-up
Turn it up-up

On the dance floor

Feel that heat rising up
Hear that beat, turn it up
Baby movin' that's what's up
Baby, baby boombercut

Boombercut
Do that dance
Got me hooking in the trance
Just like fire where's your dance?
Someone call the ambulance

I like it
You like it
You li-li-like treat your mystic
Just ride it, don't hide it
Ge-ge-ge-get down to the music
Don't stop it, keep rocking
It's bombin' like a bullet
It's burning like fire
So go ahead and loose it

Turn it up
Turn it up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up ...
For the dancefloor

Turn it up
Break it down
Shake it off
Mix it now
D-A-V-I-D take me for the dancefloor
Will. I is on represition
I'll be cutting like insition
Get a ghetto for the dancefloor (floooooor)

The G, the U, the T, the T, the A
The A-A, we don't play.
Weepy, weepy, rock, rock, rock, rock
Sh-sh-shit like every day
Feel the sound, powerful
Mega boots on overlow
Electric City pumpin' on the dance-ce-cefloor

I got that fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire for the dance floor
I got that fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire for the dance floor-floor
