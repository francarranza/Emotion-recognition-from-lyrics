Ooh baby love me right
Let me love you till you get it right
Why can't you let the others be
'Cause with you is where I got to be
Oh sugar... where've you been
Hangin' out with your male friends
Listen... somebodys gonna hurt you
The way you love to keep hurting me

Ooh baby love me right
Let me love you till the morning comes
Ooh sugar love me right
You know I want to be the only one

Let me love you till you get it right

Ooh baby... understand,
I want you to be the only man
But it seems so it's getting too hard
I think I start to have my own fun

Ooh baby... It's plain to see
That I'm qualified to fill your needs
You think you put'n over on me
Oh honey baby just you wait and see

Ooh baby love me right
Let me love you till the morning comes
Ooh sugar love me right
You know I want to be the only one

Let me love you till you get it right

Love me right
You gotta love me
Love me right
You gotta love me

Let me love you till you get it right

Ooh baby love me right
Let me love you till the morning comes
Ooh sugar love me right
You know I want to be the only one
