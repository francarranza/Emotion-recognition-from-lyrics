There's a light, a certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be 
Lived with you, lived with you
There's a way, everybody say
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, ain't got you

Baby, you don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

In my brain I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
And I'm blind, so, so, so very blind
I'm a man, can't you see what I am?
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you, ain't got you

Baby, you don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

Oh no, you don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

No no no no no, you don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
