It's coming down, babe
Could be as bad as they talked about 
It's coming down, babe
Could be before we can make it out

But when they say that all is lost, all is not lost, all is not lost
But when they say that all is lost, all is not lost, no, all is not lost at all

And they could be right about it
They could be right in some crazy way 
'Cause if they yell fire, well that's what we get
Yeah, they yell fire and that's what we get

So, yeah it's coming babe
Probably bad as they talked about 
But just remember when the tide rolls in
Can't be too long 'til it rolls back out

And when they say all is lost, all is not lost, all is not lost 
But when they say that all is lost, all is not lost, no all is not lost at all

And if they burn, if they burn this place down to the ground, what does it matter?
What does it matter now?
 
'Cause when they say that all is lost, all is not lost, all is not lost
But when they say that all is lost, all is not lost
No, all is not lost, not lost, at all
