They say that I'm the kind of person who always speaks my mind
To me there's nothing stronger then the truth
You can ask me almost anything and I'll tell you like it is
But darlin' when they ask me about you

I tell it like it use to be
When you were still in love with me
Before you got to use to me and wanted someone new
I tell it like it ought to be
When they ask about you and me I tell it like it use to be

I wish that I was stronger I could tell them that you've gone
But that's one thing that I may never do
If they want to hear about our love and how it all went wrong
Then darlin' they will just have to talk to you

I tell it like it use to be
When you were still in love with me
Before you got to use to me and wanted someone new
I tell it like it ought to be
When they ask about you and me I tell it like it use to be
