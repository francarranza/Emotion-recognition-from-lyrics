Putrid beast
Mutant with a bloody fist
Puking acid in the night

You're diseased
Medical experiments
Took away your human life

For a fee
Just a student with no money
Grabbed a flyer, paid the price

Sharp injection
Brain inspection
Pulsing anger
Mutant rancor

Splattered blood
Doctor laying on the floor
Larynx bleeding in your hand

Bloody teeth
First of many you'll be killing
Make you way into the street

Finally
The gasoline and dynamite
Will light the sky for the night

Sharp injection
Brain inspection
Pulsing anger
Mutant rancor

There's nothing to save
You're my slave
Burn the earth
For minimum wage

Burn, burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn

Pour the gas, light the match, burn
Pour the gas, light the match, burn
Pour the gas, light the match, burn
Pour the gas, light the match, burn

Pour the gas, light the match, burn
Pour the gas, light the match, burn
Pour the gas, light the match, burn
Pour the gas, light the match, burn

Death filled the streets
Killed with tusks
Once held life
Now lie husks

Burn, burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn

Burn it away get fucking paid
Incinerate organic hate
Dump all the waste poison this place
Burn it away get fucking paid now

Sharp injection
Brain inspection
Pulsing anger
Mutant rancor

There's nothing to save
You're my slave
Burn the earth
For minimum wage

There's nothing to save
You're my slave
Burn the earth
For minimum wage
