(Kenny Chesney)
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue

(Willie Nelson)
Crowded street, busy feet, hustle by him
Downtown shoppers, Christmas is nigh
There he sits all alone on the sidewalk
Hoping that you won't pass him by.

(Kenny Chesney)
Should you stop? Better not, much too busy
You'd better hurry, my how time does fly
And in the distance the ringing of laughter
(Willie Nelson) 
And in the midst of the laughter he cries

(Kenny Chesney)
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
(Willie Nelson)
Pretty pencils to write I love you
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue

Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
(Kenny Chesney)
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
(Willie Nelson)
Pretty pencils to write I love you
(Kenny Chesney)
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Oh, pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
