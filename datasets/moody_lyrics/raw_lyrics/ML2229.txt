Young girl by your side
She asks no questions
So you don't lie

How effortless it can be
She feels lucky
And you are free

But I shouldn't have loved
I shouldn't have loved you that way
But I shouldn't have loved
I shouldn't have loved you still
But I shouldn't have loved
Shouldn't have loved you that way
You that way, you that way

And now it's been two years
Do they know you still come here?
And day gives in to night
And then guilty morning light

You shouldn't have loved
You shouldn't have loved me that way
You shouldn't have loved
You shouldn't have loved me still
You shouldn't have loved me that way
Me that way, me that way

I shouldn't have loved
I shouldn't have loved you that way
I shouldn't have loved
I shouldn't have loved you still
I shouldn't have loved
I shouldn't have loved you that way
You that way, me that way
