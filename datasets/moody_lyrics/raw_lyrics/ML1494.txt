Hate, war and terror, murder, disaster
Rape, drugs and violence, lost in our failure
Fear is suffering, intimidate to obey
Fear is control, suffering is hell
Police enforce obedient behavior
Manufactured weapon of conformity
Fears of war and pestilence
Fear of loss and failure
Fear the hate of your enemy
Fear your god and savior
Savior, failure
What do you fear?
It is the most strategic tool used to manipulate
Intimidation to make me weak in order to obey
Strategy to manipulate, paralyze, intimidate
Righteous greed suffocates, a powerful fear campaign
Mind killing, restricting
Fear is the enemy on my path
Fears of war and pestilence
Fear of loss and failure
Fear the hate of your enemy
Fear your god and savior
Savior, failure
What do you fear?
Fear is your god
