At the dawn of violence
The Telkhine wizards met
On the peat of Mt. Cithren
They vowed malevolence
The call for death was sent
To command all earth and men
Behead the mega priest
Bring hell unto the streets

I hear voices
Make me kill
I hear voices
Make me kill

Evil Power
Evil Power
Evil Power

On the wings of malcontent
Another billion dead
Upon your bated breath
Their calculated death
Demonic influence
Completely pulls me in
Our fists raised to the sky
As we watch the Goddess die

I hear voices
Make me kill
I hear voices
Slaughter

Evil Power
Evil Power
Evil Power
