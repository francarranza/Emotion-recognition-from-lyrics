Spendin' too much time away
I can't stand another day
Maybe you think I've seen the world
But I'd rather see my girl

I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home
I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home
I'm goin' home, bome, bome, bome bome-bome
Home, bome, bome, bome, back home
Yes, I am

All those letters ev'ry day
Maybe all right in their way
But I'd love to see your face
When I get home in their place

I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home
I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home
I'm goin' home, bome, bome, bome-bome-bome
Home, bome, bome, bome, back home

All right

I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home
I'm goin' home, bome, bome, bome bome-bome
Home, bome, bome, bome, back home
Yes, I will

When you're three thousand miles away
I just never sleep the same
If I packed my things right now
I could be home in seven hours

I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home
I'm goin' home, I'm goin' home
I'm goin' home, bome, bome, bome bome-bome
Home, bome, bome, bome, back home
Uh, yes, I will
