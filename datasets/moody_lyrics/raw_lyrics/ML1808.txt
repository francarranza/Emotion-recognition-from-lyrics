There's a couple old people live across the road
So I keep the volume down on my radio
And all the neighbors say when I go by
He's a pretty good guy
I'm cerified in CPR 
And if you asked me to I'd fix your car
It's just the way I am
I got a pretty good life
I'm a pretty good guy

Just one good man
All the good ones are gone
Hey play it again
I like that song

There's a pretty good guy
Walking up the street
And you'd be surprised
He looks a lot like me
Since you've been gone I've realized
That you were wrong
I'm a pretty good guy
And it didn't take long
I'm a pretty good guy
