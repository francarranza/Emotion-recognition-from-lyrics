Don't leave
'Cause I believe
We were meant to see
In the dirt

Don't leave
'Cause I believe
We were meant to see
In the dirt

Don't leave
'Cause I believe
We were meant to see
In the dirt

If you doubt
That I'll be there
Don't despair
Don't you dare
If you doubt
That I'll be there
Don't despair
Don't you dare
If you doubt
That I'll be there
Don't despair
Don't you dare
If you doubt
That I'll be there
Don't despair
Don't you dare

Don't leave
'Cause I believe
We were meant to see
In the dirt
