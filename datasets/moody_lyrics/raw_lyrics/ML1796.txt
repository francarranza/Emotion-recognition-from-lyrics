Hate and war
The only things we got today

And if I close my eyes
It will not go away
You have to deal with it
It is the currency

Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate

The hate of a nation
A million miles from home
I got war from the junkies
Who don't like my form

I'm gonna stay in the city
Even when a house fall down
I don't dream of a holiday
When hate and war come around

Hate and war
The only thing we got today
Hate and war
The only thing

I have no will to survive
I cheat if I can't win
If someone locks me out
I kick my way back in

And if I get aggression
I give 'em two time back
Every day it's just the same
With hate an' war on my back

Hate and war, I hate English men
Hate and war, just as bad as wops
Hate and war, I hate all the p'liteness
Hate and war, I hate all the cops

Hate and war, I wanna walk down any street
Hate and war, dressed like a creep
Hate and war, I don't care if I get beat up
Hate and war, by any woggin' Greek
