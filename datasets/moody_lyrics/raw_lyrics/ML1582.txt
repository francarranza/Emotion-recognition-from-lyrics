They'll look you in the eyes and
Stone you
Then turn and disown you
Don't let it take the fight outta you
They'll walk all over your name
Till they find someone else to blame
Don't let it take the fight outta you
Secrets hide their lies
Inside hidden alibis
Don't let it take the fight outta you
They put the world on a hook
It's worse every time I look

I would rather take the punch
Than not give you a shot
I'd rather find out who you are
Than who you're not
Shoulda known better
Than to mistake business for love
Shoulda known better
Than to mistake a fist for a glove

It will be in your honor
Till you're not needed any longer
Don't let it take the fight outta you
Don't believe the headlines
Check it for yourself sometimes


Don't let it take the fight outta you
The lies you live become you
The love you lose it numbs you
Don't let it take the fight outta you
They say that you've arrived
That's just a high class bribe
Don't let it take the fight outta you

I would rather take your punch
Than not give you a shot
I'd rather find out who you are
Than who you're not
Shoulda known better
Than to mistake business for love
Shouda known better
Than to mistake a fist for a glove

There's always someone younger
Someone with more hunger
They'll say you're one and only
Then straight up leave you lonely
Like a transplant patient
Waiting for a donor
Like a half empty balloon
After a party in the corner
