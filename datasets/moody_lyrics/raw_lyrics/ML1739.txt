Whatever happened to Saturday Night
When you dressed up sharp and you felt alright
It don't seem the same since cosmic light
Came into my life, I thought I was divine
I used to drive around with a chick who'd go
And listen to the music on the radio
A saxophone was blowing on a rock 'n' roll show
You climbed in the back seat
Really had a good time

Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll

My head used to swim from the perfume I smelt
My hands kinda fumbled with her white plastic belt
I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt
She'd whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine
Get back in front, put some hair oil on
Buddy Holly was singing his very last song
With your arms around you girl you try to sing along
You felt pretty good, woo
Really had a good time

Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll

Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll

Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
