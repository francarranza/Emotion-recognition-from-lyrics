Oh woman you make me feel...
Like I'm on fire,
Oh woman you make me feel...
Like I'm on fire,
Oh woman you make me feel...
Like I'm on fire,
Oh woman you make it real...
It's the only way for me

Oh woman you make me feel...
Like I'm on fire,
Oh woman you make it real...
It's the only way for me

Oh woman you make me feel...
Like I'm on fire,
Oh woman you make it real...
It's the only way for me
