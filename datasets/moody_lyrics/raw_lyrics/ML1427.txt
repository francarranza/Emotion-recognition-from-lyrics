You're my love, you're my angel
You're the girl of my dreams
I'd like to thank you for waiting patiently, yeah, yeah
Daddy's home, your daddy's home to stay, yeah, yeah

How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side (to be by your side)
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had teardrops in your eyes, yeah
Daddy's home, your daddy's home to stay

It wasn't on a Sunday
Monday and Tuesday went by
It wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon
All I could do was cry
But I made a promise that you treasured
I made it back home to you

How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side (to be by your side)
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had teardrops in your eyes, yeah
Daddy's home, your daddy's home to stay, yeah, yeah

Daddy's home
(To stay) I'm not a thousand miles away
(Daddy's home) Yeah
(To stay) And I'm gonna be here, come with me
(Daddy's home) Come with me
(To stay) I'm not a thousand miles away
(Daddy's home) Yeah
