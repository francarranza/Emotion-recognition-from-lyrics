Strap my derriere to a padded chair
I fly the air in a tin can
From here to there on a wing and a prayer
I don't even know where I am
I'm a wanderin fool burnin fossil fuel
Sending arrows into the dark
But I'm just lookin' for a place where I can fall apart

Throw all of my junk into the Alamo trunk
And I pull out into the lane
Cell phone's dead there's mountains ahead
I don't even slow down for the rain
There was a time when the road was mine
And the path was lined with sparks
Now I'm just lookin' for a place where I can fall apart

It's in the air the scent of despair
Nobody wants to talk about it
We're all scared we're gonna lose our share of the dream
Can't live without it

My clothes are funky I'm a sugar junkie
I'm a promo monkey in a cage
I lunge for the carrot repeat like a parrot
Till I step out onto the stage
The lights go down and I see your faces
Shinin through the dark
And I'm just lookin' for a place where I can fall apart
Oh can I let my guard down tonight?
Is it safe enough to fall apart?
