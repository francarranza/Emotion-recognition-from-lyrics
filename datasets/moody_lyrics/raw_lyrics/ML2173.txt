Sitting with you sinking in the shade
Eating while we're sleeping, yeah I'm losing sleep
You say "Why do you feel so fine?"
I said it's lovely, yeah it's lovely, yes it's lovely outside

Please don't be sad, my baby, no
Please don't be sad, my baby, no
Please don't be sad, I know you're mine, oh yeah, you're mine
Please don't be sad, my baby, no
Please don't be sad, my baby, no
Please don't be sad, I know you're mine, oh yeah, you're mine

Thinking of you, thinking in the shade
Sleeping while I eat, repeat the things that I say
I say "Why do I feel so shy?"
I said it's lovely, yeah it's lovely, oh so lovely outside

Please don't be sad, my baby, no
Please don't be sad, my baby, no
Please don't be sad, I know you're mine, oh yeah, you're mine
Please don't be sad, my baby, no
Please don't be sad, my baby, no
Please don't be sad, I know you're mine, oh yeah, you're mine
