There's sap in the trees if you tap 'em

There's blood on the seas if you map 'em

Christian, if you see your poppa

Tell him I love him

He taught me to love in the wild and

Fight in the gym



He taught me the bottle gives birth to the cup

And you won't get hurt if you just

Keep your hands up

And stand tall

Like sycamores



Sycamore got to grow down to grow up

Young girl told the soul like baby's first cup

And when they bend you in two 

And say too green for the fire

When all you want to do is be a part of the fire

All you want to do is be the fire part of fire

Like sycamores



There's sap in the trees if you tap 'em

There's blood on the seas if you map 'em

Christian when I see your poppa

I'll tell him you love him

And remember to love in the wild and

Fight in the gym

Remember the bottle gives birth to the cup

And you won't get hurt if you just 

Keep your hands up

And stand tall

Like sycamores
