They say I'm crazy the way you got me open, baby ooh
They say I'm buggin' the way I'm top sweatin' your lovin', ooh
They all sit and wonder why this feelin' I can not hide
It ain't a question of pride, ooh
It's love, ooh it's love

They say I'm slippin' the way you got my whole life flippin', ooh
They say I'm losin' it 'cause I can't seem to keep my grip, baby ooh
We all cry when we feel pain, when love is gone we're not the same
It ain't a question of brains
Ooh it's love, ooh it's love
Ooh it's love, ooh it's love

Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love

They all sit and wonder why this feelin' I can not hide
It ain't a question of pride
(Adlib) it's love
(Adlib) its love

Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
