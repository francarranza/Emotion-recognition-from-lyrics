Deep is the love
Love that is deep within the sea
Lifting me high
High as the eagle in the sky

Soaring above the cloud
Where I can find the sea
Closer to you, I feel
Your love surrounding me

Like the color green
You're in every stream
You're in everything
Even in my dreams

You're my color green
You're my favorite thing
Like the song I sing
What a precious thing

Great is your love
Touching the deepest part of me
You open my heart
Revealing to me the mystery

You never grow old to me
With you each day is new
For all that you've done for me
I give my life to you, you

Like the color green
You're in every stream
You're in everything
Even in my dreams

You're my color green
You're my favorite thing
Like the song I sing
What a precious thing

Like the color green
You're in every stream
You're in everything
Even in my dreams

You're my color green
My favorite thing
Like a song I sing
What a precious thing

You're my color green
You're in every stream
What a precious thing
Like the color green, yes

You're in everything

Like the color green
You're in every stream
You're in everything
Even in my dreams

Like the color green
You're my favorite thing
Like the song I sing
You're in everything
What a precious thing

You're my color green
You're my, you're my everything
You're in every stream
What a precious thing
