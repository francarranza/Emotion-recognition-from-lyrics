She said, she'd take me anyway, she'd take me everyway
As long as she stays with me
She said, she'd take me everyway, she'd take me anyway
As long as I'm good and clean

Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips

She said, she'd take me anytime, she'd take me every time
As long as she stays with me
She said, she'd take me everyday, she'd take me everyway
And it would be free

Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips

She said, she'd take me anyway, she'd take me everyway
As long as she stays with me
She said, she'd take me everywhere, she's take me anywhere
As long as I'm good and clean

Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
Kiss, kiss Molly's lips
