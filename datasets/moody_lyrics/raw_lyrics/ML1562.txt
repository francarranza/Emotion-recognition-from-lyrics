I'm lookin' for a place to go so I can be all alone
From thoughts and memories
So that when the music plays I don't go back to the days
When love was you and me

Oh, oh...
Moja droga, ja cię kocham
Means that I love you so
Moja droga, ja cię kocham
More than you'll ever know
Kocham ciebie calym serce
Love you with all my heart
Return to me, and always be
My melody of love

Wish I had a place to hide all my sorrow, all my pride
I just can't get along
'Cause the love once so fine keeps on hurtin' all the time
Where did I go wrong?

Oh, oh...
Moja droga, ja cię kocham
Means that I love you so
Moja droga, ja cię kocham
More than you'll ever know
Kocham ciebie calym serce
Love you with all my heart
Return to me, and always be
My melody of love

Oh, oh,
My melody of love
My melody of love
My melody of love
