Tommy gun, you ain't happy unless you got one
Tommy gun, ain't gonna shoot the place up just for fun
Maybe he wanna die for the money
Maybe he wants to kill for his country
Whatever he wants, he's gonna get it

Tommy gun, you better strip it down for a customs run
Tommy gun, waiting in the airport till kingdom come
And we can watch you make it on the 9:00 news
Standing there in Palestine, lighting a fuse
Whatever you want, you're gonna get it

Tommy gun

Tommy gun, you'll be dead when your war is won
Tommy gun, but did you have to gun down everyone?
I can see it's kill or be killed
A nation of destiny has got to be fulfilled
Whatever you want, you're gonna get it

Tommy gun, you can be a hero in an age of none
Tommy gun, I'm cutting out your picture from page one
I'm gonna get a jacket just like yours
And give my full support to your cause
Whatever you want, you're gonna get it

So let's agree about the price
And make it one jet airliner for ten prisoners
Boats and tanks and planes, it's your game
Kings and queens and generals learn your name

I see all the innocents
The human sacrifice
And if death comes so cheap
Then the same goes for life
