I don't think it's right
Lettin' love ruin my life
But I don't think it's wrong
Gettin' a little revenge in a song
It hurts, don't lie

Who you gonna run to?
Who you gonna run to now?
You know I woulda died for you for you
But it wasn't like you loved me anyhow
You know I'm right
You know I'm right

Maybe I been wrong
Maybe I been livin' a little headstrong
But no it isn't right
(Start) Startin' a war by avoiding a fight
It hurts, don't lie

Who you gonna run to?
Who you gonna run to now?
You know I woulda died for you
But it wasn't like you loved me anyhow
You know I'm right
You know I'm right

Who you gonna run to?
Who you gonna run to now?

Who you gonna run to?
Who you gonna run to now?

Who you gonna run to?
Who you gonna run to now?
(You know I'm right)

Who you gonna run to?
Who you gonna run to now?
(You know I'm right)
