And when I go away 
I know my heart can stay with my love
It's understood 
It's in the hands of my love
And my love does it good

Woah-wa-wa-woah
Woah-wa-wa-woah
My love does it good 

And when the cupboards bare 
I'll still find something there with my love
It's understood
It's everywhere with my love
My love does it good

Woah-wa-wa-woah
Woah-wa-wa-woah
My love does it good 

Oh, woah, I love
Oh, woah, my love
Only my love holds the other key to me 
Oh, oh, my love
Oh, woah, my love 
Only my love does it good to me

Woah-wa-wa-woah
Woah-wa-wa-woah
My love does it good

Don't ever ask me why
I never say goodbye to my love
It's understood
It's everywhere with my love 
My love does it good, woah

Woah-wa-wa-woah
Woah-wa-wa-woah
My love does it good

Woah, woah, I love
Oh, woah, my love 
Only my love does it good to me
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
