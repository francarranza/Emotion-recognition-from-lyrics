Distant stars come in black or red
I've seen their worlds inside my head
They connect with the fall of man
They breathe you in
And dive as deep as they can

There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising
There's nothing you can say to him
He is in outer heart
And the space has been broken

It's broken
Our love
It's broken
It's broken
Our love
Broken

Is it far away in the glitter freeze
Or in our eyes every time they meet
It's by the light of the plasma screens
We keep switched on
All through the night while we sleep

There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising
There's nothing you can say to her
I am without a heart
And the space has been broken

It's broken
Our love
Broken
It's broken
Our love
Broken
It's broken
Our love
It's broken
It's broken
Our Love
Broken
