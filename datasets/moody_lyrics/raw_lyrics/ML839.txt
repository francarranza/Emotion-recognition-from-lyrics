God Bless America,
Land that I love.
Stand beside her, and guide her,
Through the night with the light from above.

From the mountains, to the prairies,
To the oceans, wide with hope,
God Bless America,
My home sweet home.

God Bless America,
My home sweet home
God Bless America

From the mountains, to the prairies,
To the oceans, wide with hope,
God Bless America,
My home sweet home.

God Bless America,
