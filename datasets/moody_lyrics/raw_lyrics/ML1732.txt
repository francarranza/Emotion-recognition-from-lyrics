Crystal river 
Got a woman on the other side 
Crystal river 
Got a woman on the other side 
And nothin' can touch me here 
Nothin' can touch me here 
Nothin' can touch me here 
On crystal river 

I love her 
I swear by the diamond sky 
I love her 
I swear by the diamond sky 
And nothin' can touch me here 
And nothin' can touch me here 
And nothin' can touch me here 
On crystal river 

I'm dreamin' 
Dreamin' where 
The water's wide 
Crystal river 
Got a woman on the other side 
And nothin' can touch me here 
Nothin' can touch me here 
No nothin' can touch me here 
On crystal river 

--- 

She's sleeping 
Sleeping by the water side 
She's sleeping 
Out there on that bank 
She lies 
And nothin' can touch me here 
Nothin' can touch me here 
No nothin' can touch me here 
On crystal river
