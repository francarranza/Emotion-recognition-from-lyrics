In the chill of the night
I can feel my heart racing
As I run towards the light
That seems so far away
Wondering forever
In the darkest of shadows
Wondering if I will ever see you again

Wondering if I will ever see you again

I'll take your love
(I'll take your love)
I'll take your hate
(Take your hate)
I'll take you're desire

I'll take the world
When it turns on you
(When it turns on you)
I'll set it on fire

W-the-w-th-th-the walking dead
The walking dead (walking dead)

Digging in the dirt
I can feel you getting closer
Steadying my hands through the blistering pain
Anxiously awaiting for the earth to reveal you
Wondering if I will ever see you again (see you again)

Wondering if I will ever see you again

I'll take your love
(I'll take your love)
I'll take your hate
(Take your hate)
I'll take you're desire

I'll take your heart
I'll take your pain
(I'll take your pain)
I'll bring you to life

I'll bring you to life

W-the-w-th-th-the walking dead
The walking dead (walking dead)

I'll bring you to life

I'll take your love
(I'll take your love)
I'll take your hate
(Take your hate)
I'll take you're desire

I'll take the world
When it turns on you
(It turns on you)

W-the-w-th-th-the walking dead

I'll take your love
(I'll take your love)
I'll take your hate
(Take your hate)
I'll take you're desire

I'll take your heart
I'll take your pain
(I'll take your pain)

I'll bring you to life
