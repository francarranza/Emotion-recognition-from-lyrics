Bad girls
Talking about the sad girls
Sad girls
Talking about bad girls, yeah

See them out on the street at night 
Picking up on all kinds of strangers
If the price is right
You can't score if your pocket's tight
But you want a good time

You ask yourself
Who they are
Like everybody else
They come from near and far

Friday night and the strip is hot
Sun's gone down and they're out to trot 
Spirit's high and legs look hot
Do you wanna get down?

Now don't you ask yourself
Who they are
Like everybody else
They wanna be a star

Sad girls, you such a dirty bad girl
Beep-beep uh uh
You bad girl you sad girl
You such a dirty bad girl
Beep-Beep uh uh

Now you and me, we're both the same
But you call yourself by different names
Now your mama won't like it when she finds out
That her girl is out at night



Hey, mister, have you got a dime?
Mister, do you want to spent some time? Oh, yeah
I got what you want, you got what I need
I'll be your baby, come and spend it on me
Hey mister, I'll spend some time with you
