Mind of chaos sorrow
This within my blood
Life of sickness evil
This within my blood

Cannot see what lies ahead
When moon is gone and the son is dead
Cannot fly with broken wings
As darkness encompasses all things
Something inside of me has died
Or ceases to exist
I walk this earth alone
Evil demons rule my life
Evil inside torment my life

Evil inside
Controlling my life
Cannot escape what is within my blood
Cannot escape what is within my blood
Evil demons now control my life
