I'm trading my sorrows I'm trading my shame
I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord

I'm trading my sickness I'm trading my pain
I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord

We say
Yes Lord yes Lord yes yes Lord
Yes Lord yes Lord yes yes Lord

I am pressed but not crushed
Persecuted not abandoned
Struck down but not destroyed
I am blessed beyond the curse
For His promise will endure
That His joy's gonna be my strength

Though the sorrow may last for the night
His joy comes with the morning

I'm trading my sorrows I'm trading my shame
I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord
