Hey Mr. Music
Ya sure sound good to me
I can't refuse it
What have we got to be

Feel like dancing
Dance 'cause we are free

I got my own
In the promise land
But I feel at home
Can you overstand

Until the road is rocky
Sure feels good to me
And if your lucky
Together we'd always be

I will ride it
The sun is a risin'
The sun is a risin'

I will ride it
I will ride it

I will ride it
I will ride it

Rainbow country
Rainbow country

Rainbow country

Hey mr. music

Can you understand

Until the road is rock
Sure feels good to me
And if I'm lucky
Together we'd always be

I will ride it
The sun is a risin'
The sun is a risin'
Moon is a risin'

I will ride it
I will ride it

I will ride it
I will ride it

Until the road is rocky
Sure feels good to me
And if I'm lucky
Together we'd always be

I will ride it
