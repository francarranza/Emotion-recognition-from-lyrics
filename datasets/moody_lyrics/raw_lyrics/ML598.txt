One day we'll walk in the sun

My name is Vernon James
And I live to the south of town
I work my window, watching the women
Go 'round and 'round

Some people come here for love
Some people come for fantasy
When two in the morning comes around
My baby comes around for me

Someone come, come my someone
Take the clouds from my eyes, my one
I know that sometime soon
One day we'll walk in the sun

I'm taking tickets
Watching the men always looking down
Sometimes I feel like an animal
In the zoo, staring out

No one looks me in the eye
They save it for the girls inside
I don't much care what they see
I know she saves it all for me

Someone come, come my someone
Take the clouds from my eyes, my one
I know that sometime soon
One day we'll walk in the sun

Some people come here for love
Some come for curiosity
I know there will be a day
I know we'll figure out a way

Someone come, come my someone
Take the clouds from my eyes, my one
I know that sometime soon
One day we'll walk in the sun

Someone come, come my someone
Take the clouds from my eyes, my one
I know that sometime soon
One day we'll walk in the sun

One day we'll walk in the sun
One day we'll walk in the sun
One day we'll walk in the sun
One day we'll walk in the sun
