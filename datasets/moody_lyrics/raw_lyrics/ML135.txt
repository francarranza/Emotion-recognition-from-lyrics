I love you whether or not you love me
I love you even if you think that I don't
Sometimes I find you doubt my love for you
But I don't mind
Why should I mind
Why should I mind

What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway

Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear
Never worry never be sad
The answer is they cannot love this much nobody can
This is why I don't mind you doubting

What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway

And maybe love is letting people be just what they want to be
The door always must be left unlocked
To love when circumstance may lead someone away from you
And not to spend the time just doubting

What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway

What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway

What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
