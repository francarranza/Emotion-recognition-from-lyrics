Listen
From the day we met you had me on the run
I tried to fight it but it's about to take it's toll
I can't stop it now I think I found the groove
One more night and I'll make my move

See Lady Luck came on my side
It's a hard knock line strung with some vibe
No matter what you'll say or do
I can't live my life without you

Give me some satisfaction
Just to hear of your action
I want your love (I want your love)
Gimme your love (gimme your love)

Early in the morning
You had my pony jonnin'
I need your love (I need your love)
Gimme your love (gimme your love) Listen

I can't go to work without a taste of your love
I never hold or take, leads me right back home
It might sound strange but I'm addicted to your smile
And the way you move girl it drives me wild yeah

Never know it's wrong till want so bad
When the want is right I think the wrong can't be bad
No matter what you put me through
I want to spend my life with you

Give me some satisfacton
Just to hear of your action
I want your love (I want your love)
Gimme your love (gimme your love)

Early in the morning
You got my pony jonnin'
I want your love (I want your love)
Gimme your love (Gimme your love)

Give me some satisfacton
Just to hear of your action
I want your love (I want your love)
Gimme your love (gimme your love)

Early in the morning
You got my pony jonnin'
I want your love (I want your love)
Gimme your love (Gimme your love)
