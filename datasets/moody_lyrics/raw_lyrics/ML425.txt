Where is the love (where is the love)
Where is the love (where is the love)
Where is the love (where is the love)
Where is the love

Where is the love you said you'd give to me
Soon as you were free
Will it ever be
Where is the love?

You told me that you didn't love him
And you were gonna say goodbye
But if you really didn't mean it
Why did you have to lie?

Where is the love you said was mine all mine
Till the end of time
Was it just a lie
Where is the love

If you had had a sudden change of heart
I wish that you would tell me so
Don't leave me hanging on to promises
You've got to let me know

Oh, how I wish I'd never met you
I guess it must have been my fate
To fall in love with someone else's love
All I can do is wait
(That's all I can do, yeah yeah yeah)

Where is the love (where is the love)
Where is the love (where is the love)
Where is the love (where is the love)
Where is the love (where is the love)

Where is the love (where is the love)
Where is the love (where is the love)
Where is the love (where is the love)
Where is the love (where is the love)

Where is the love (where is the love)
