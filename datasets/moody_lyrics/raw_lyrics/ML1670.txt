Silent Night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
Round, young virgin
Mother and Child
Holy Infant 
So tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent Night
Holy night
Son of God
Loves pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face

With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at Thy birth
Jesus Lord at Thy birth

Silent Night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
Round, young virgin
Mother and Child
Holy Infant 
So tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Sleep in heavenly peace...
