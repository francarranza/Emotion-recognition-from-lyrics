Spending my day
Thinkin' 'bout you, girl
Being here with you
Being near with you
I can't explain myself
Why I feel like I do
Though it hurt me so
To let you know

When I look in your eyes
You let me know how you feel
Let me know that love is really real

Well, it seems to me
That I'm wrapped up in your love
Don't you know that I'm
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sure enough in love with you (hey)

When I look in your eyes
And all the years I see
Me lovin' you and you lovin' me

Well it seems to me
That I'm wrapped up in your love
Don't you know that I'm
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sure enough in love with you
Hey, I ...
Don't you know that I'm
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sure enough in love with you
I ...
