You bruise so easily love
Our heart's racing again
Once the bloom leaves the rose
All that's left is regret and sorrow

Don't be a stranger
Misanthrope
Don't take my hand 
If you know you'll never love again

It's the death of romance
The death of romance
The death of romance
It's the death of romance

The rope's too tight around my hands
I don't want to understand
Obscured by light, a stain inside
Even your tattooed cross
Is too heavy to bear

Angels sing that closing hymn to me
Can't you hear
Those angels sing the closing hymn to me

It's the death of romance
The death of romance
The death of romance
It's the death of romance

It's the death of you and me
It's not the end you see
Well patience got to pay
The price tonight

It's the death of romance
Death of romance
