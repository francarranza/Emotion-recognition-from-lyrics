What makes them walk away, after all these years?
These years are learning it the hard way by the lessons from the tears
I know it's not a game
But it feels like losing when someone you love throws you away
I'd fix it
I'd fix it
I'd fix it
I'd fix it if I could
And I'd always win
I'd always win
I'd always win in the end

How easy was it for you making those plans you made?
Before I became someone for you, you know to dislocate
But, I know it's not a game
But if feels like losing when someone you love throws you away
I'd fix it
I'd fix it
I'd fix it
I'd fix it if I could
And I'd always win
I'd always win
And you'd always lose

Look what I did to you
Look what you did to me
Fix it
Fix it
I'd fix it if I could
And I'd always win
I'd always win
I'd always win in the end
