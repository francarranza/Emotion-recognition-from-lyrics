When I feel
You dreaming
I think of sunsets
How high my high gets

I wanna give you an everlasting love
I wanna fill your life with a satisfying love
All you need is an everlasting love
All you want is a satisfying love

Summer breezes
Moonlight teases
Friendly invasion
Late night persuasion

I wanna give you an everlasting love
Wanna fill your life with a satisfying love
All you need is an everlasting love
All you want is a mystifying love

Each
Time you
Pass
Me by
You slowly fade away
I need you more each day

I wanna give you an everlasting love
Wanna fill your life with a satisfying love
All you need is an everlasting love
All you want is a mystifying love
