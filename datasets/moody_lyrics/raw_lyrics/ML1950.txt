Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land, that I heard of once
In a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Some day, I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Way up above the chimney tops
Thats where you'll find me

I know somewhere over the rainbow
The blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I

Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why and why can't I
