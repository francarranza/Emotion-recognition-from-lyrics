Lover please, please come back
Don't take a train comin' down the track
Don't, please don't, don't leave me
Don't leave me in misery

You would never hold me so near
You would never call me "Dear"
Dontcha know I'd die for you?
Now you're gone, that's what I'll do

Lover please, please come back
Don't take a train comin' down the track
Don't, please don't, don't leave me
Don't leave me in misery

All those stories, not too long
About a love that went all wrong
The girl left the boy, just as bad
Now she's gone, she's so sad

Lover please, please come back
Don't take a train comin' down the track
Don't, please don't, don't leave me
Don't leave me in misery

You would never hold me so near
You would never have called me "Dear"
Dontcha know I'd die for you?
Now you're gone, that's what I'll do

Lover please, please come back
Don't take a train comin' down the track
Don't, please don't, don't leave me
Don't leave me in misery
