Oh
Oh
You've been good to me
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be
In love with you
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl
Thank you girl

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love
I know, little girl, only a fool
Would doubt our love
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl
Thank you girl

Thank you girl for lovin' me the way that you do
Way that you do
That's the kind of love that is too good to be true
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl
Thank you girl

Oh
Oh
Mm, you be good to me
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be
In love with you
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl
Thank you girl 

Oh
Oh
Oh

Oh
Oh
Oh

Oh
Oh
