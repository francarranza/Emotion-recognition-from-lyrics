Some will learn, many do
Cover up or spread it out
Turn around had enough
Pick and choose or pass it on

Buying in, heading for
Suffer now or suffer then
It's bad enough I want the fear
Need the fear 'cause he's alone


He's alone


Well if they're making it 
Then they're pushing it 
And they're leading us along
The hassle of 
All the screaming fits 
That panic makes remorse

After all, what's the point?
Cause levitation is possible
If you're a fly, achieved and gone
There's time for this and so much more

It's typical, create a world
A special place of my design
To never cope or never care
Just use the key 'cause he's alone


He's alone


Well if they're making it 
Then they're pushing it 
And they're leading us along
The hassle of 
All the screaming fits 
That panic makes remorse

Over and over a slave became
Over and over a slave became
Over and over a slave became
Over and over a slave

Well if they're making it 
Then they're pushing it 
And they're leading us along
The hassle of 
All the screaming fits 
That panic makes remorse

Well if they're making it 
Then they're pushing it 
And they're leading us along
Like a cancer caused 
All the screaming fits 
And their panic makes remorse
