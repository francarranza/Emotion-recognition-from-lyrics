I get a constant busy signal
When I call you on the phone
I get a strong uneasy feeling
You're not sitting there alone
I'm having nasty nasty visions
And baby you're in every one, yeah
And I'm so afraid I'm gonna find you with
A still hot and smokin gun

Maybe you want to end it,
You've had your fill of my kind of fun
But you don't know how to tell me
And you know that I'm not that dumb
I put 2 and 1 together
And you know that's not an easy sum
And I know just where to find you with
A still hot and smokin gun

I'm standing here bewildered,
I can't remember just what I've done
I can hear the sirens whining,
My eyes blinded by the sun
I know that I should be running,
My heart's beating just like a drum
Now they've knocked me down and takin it,
A still hot and smokin gun

Yeah still hot and smokin gun
Yes they've taken it
Still hot and smokin gun
Oh they've taken it
Still hot and smokin gun
Knocked me down, taken it
