Don't understand why you can't see through me
My heart is one, calling out to you
No other love can give you what you're needing
No one is there like I am for you

He'll never change your life
He'll never change your life, girl
He doesn't know you like I do
He don't know you at all

All I can ask is your time
Just a little of your time, baby
All I can ever want is a chance to prove

I'm tellin' you, my heart wants to be there for you
Your heart, is it someone there?
My heart wants to be there for you, love
My heart wants to be there

You want to be a full time affection
He only gives when he's here to give
My love is here to give you direction
But how can you have what you just won't believe

He'll never change your life
He'll never change you, girl
He doesn't know you like I do
He don't know you at all

All I can ask is your time
Five minutes alone, baby
All I can ever want is a chance to prove

My heart wants to be there for you
Your heart, is it someone there?
My heart wants to be there for you, love
Be there for you, love

You never change your life
You never change your life
He doesn't know you like I do
He don't know you at all, baby

All I can ask is your time
Just five minutes of your time, girl
All I can ever want is a chance to prove

I'm telling you, my heart wants to be there for you
Your heart, is it someone there?
My heart wants to be there for you, love

My heart wants to be there for you
Your heart, is it someone there?
My heart wants to be there for you, love

My heart wants to be there for you
Your heart, is there someone there?
My heart wants to be there for you, love
