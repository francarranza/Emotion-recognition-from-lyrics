We've been together since way back when
Sometimes I never want to see you again
But I want you to know, after all these years
You're still the one I want whispering in my ear

You're still the one I want to talk to in bed
Still the one that turns my head
We're still having fun and you're still the one

I looked at your face every day
But I never saw it 'til I went away
When winter came, I just wanted to go (Wanted to go)
Deep in the desert, I longed for the snow

You're still the one that makes me laugh
Still the one that's my better half
We're still having fun and you're still the one

You're still the one that makes me strong
Still the one I want to take along
We're still having fun and you're still the one
Yes, you are

Ooh
Ooh

Changing, our love is going gold
Even though we grow old, it grows new

You're still the one that I love to touch
Still the one and I can't get enough
We're still having fun and you're still the one

You're still the one who can scratch my itch
(You're) Still the one that I wouldn't switch
We're still having fun and you're still the one

You are still the one that makes me shout
Still the one that I dream about
We're still having fun and you're still the one

You are still the one
You're still the one
We're still having fun and you're still the one
