You better give 'em what they really own
We got to put you down
When we come into town

Singing power to the people

I gotta ask you comrades and brothers
How do you treat you own woman back home
She got to be herself
So she can free herself

Singing power to the people

Now, now, now, now

Oh well, power to the people
