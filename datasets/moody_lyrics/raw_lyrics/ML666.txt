I laid there feeling sorry for myself
In a bed of kleenex
Stuffin chocolates in my mouth
On the phone with my best friend cussin my ex
He broke my heart
Felt like the world had ended
I cried myself to sleep
Thinkin' I can't get over him

Strange
Talk about luck I woke up
And the sun was shining
Strange
I oughta be in bed with my head
In the pillow cryin over us
But I ain't, ain't love strange

Got half a mind to spend my whole paycheck
On one of those dresses
Those strapless black ones
That are famous for teaching lessons
Drop by his place
Pick up the rest of my things
He'll tell me I look good
I'll laugh and say yeah isn't time

Strange
Talk about luck I woke up
And the sun was shining
Strange
I oughta be in bed with my head
In the pillow crying over us
But I ain't, ain't love strange

Strange

Strange
Talk about luck I woke up
And the sun was shining
Strange
I oughta be in the bed with my head
In the pillow crying over us
But I ain't, ain't love strange

Strange
Talk about luck I woke up
And the sun was shining
Strange
Strange
