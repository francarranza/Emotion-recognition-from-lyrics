You should have never said you loved me
As you laid across my folding bed
You should have never said you loved me
As you laid across my folding bed
Drinkin' your white lightning, baby
Talkin' all out of your head

You said, "Baby, baby, baby, buh-buh-baby
Baby, that's all right with me"
You said, "Duh-duh-dad, daddy, daddy
Daddy, that's all right with me"
You can have my juicy lovin'
But don't you throw it in the deep blue sea
