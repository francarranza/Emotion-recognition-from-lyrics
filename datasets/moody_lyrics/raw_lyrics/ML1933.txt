Just kiss me
And forget all about that other stuff
Kiss me
Your big red lips, I think, will be enough

Don't worry with your lipstick
I'm gonna kiss it all away
Throw away your lipstick
That ain't your color, anyway

My lips are your color
So lips, stick with me!

Ooh, when you kiss me
I've got to know just how much you miss me

Kiss me
And I'll take your lips to paradise
Kiss me
And paradise will never feel so nice

You're beautiful
You don't need all that make up
And you don't need to take up, sugar
All of your time in front of the mirror
Can't you see that you're my deara
Baby, can't you see we're in love

Ooh, when you kiss me
I've got to know just how much you miss me

Kiss me
And put all the stars back in the sky
Kiss me
And maybe then you'll know the reason why
I want you
And my love's gonna haunt you
And I'm gonna flaunt you

In front of all the boys that live on my street
And they're gonna be jealous 'cause you're so sweet
Do you think I should repeat
Do you think I should repeat
Repeat
Repeat

Aw, say it, man!

I'm in love
Love
In love

I'm in love
Sweet love
