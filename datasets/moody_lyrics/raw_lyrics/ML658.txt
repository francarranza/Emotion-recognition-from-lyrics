The look of the cake it ain't, it ain't always the taste
My ex girl she had such, such a beautiful face
I wanted love, but not for myself
But for the girl so she could, so she could love herself

Oh, my next girl
Will be nothin' like my ex girl
I made mistakes back then
I'll never do it again

Oh, my next girl
She'll be nothin' like my ex girl
It was a painful dance
Now I got a second chance

A beautiful face and a, and a wicked way
And I'm payin' for her beautiful face everyday
All that work over, over so much time
If I, if I think too hard I might lose my mind

Oh, my next girl, yeah
Will be nothin' like my ex girl
I made mistakes back then
I'll never do it again

With my next girl
She'll be nothin' like my ex girl
That was a painful dance
Now I got a second chance

Oh, my next girl, yeah
My next girl
