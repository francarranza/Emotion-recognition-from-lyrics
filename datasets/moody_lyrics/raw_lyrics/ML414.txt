Whenever I chance to meet some old friends on the street
They wonder how does a man get to be this way
I've always got a smilin' face any time and any place
And every time they ask me why I just smile and say
You've got to kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin' and love her like a devil when you get back home

Well people may try to guess the secret of happiness
But some of them never learn it's a simple thing
The secret I'm speaking of is a woman and a man in love
And the answer is in the song that I always sing
You've got to kiss an angel good mornin'...
Kiss an angel good mornin'...
