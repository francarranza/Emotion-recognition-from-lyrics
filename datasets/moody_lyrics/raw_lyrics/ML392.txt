All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you

All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you

When I found out that you were leaving me
I coudn't sleep thinking about
All the things that we've been through
Now all I want to do is tell you
That I miss you so much
You know I really really miss you

All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you

All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you

Now that I'm on my own
I know that in time I'll find somebody new
Who'll treat me better than you
So now that I'm all alone without you
But I still love you
You know I'll never live without you

All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you

All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you

I wish you'd change your ways soon enough
So we can be together
You just don't understand the word love
But now all we have is memories

All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you
All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you
