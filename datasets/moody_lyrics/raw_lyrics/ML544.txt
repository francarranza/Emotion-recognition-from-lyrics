I don't know how many stars there are
Up in the heavenly sky
I only know my heaven is here on earth
Each time you look into my eyes
The way you do baby

Thank you, thank you baby

My beautiful bird you have flown away
I held you too tight I can see
You're all I need to get by
No else can make me cry
The way you do baby

You are the book that I read each day
You are the song that I sing (Gonna sing it to you)
You are the four seasons of my life
But maybe tomorrow you'll change your mind girl
Maybe tomorrow you'll come back to my arms girl
Maybe she'll come

Baby, you're all I need to get by
No one else can make me cry
The way you do baby, cause

You are the book that I read each day
You are the song that I sing (Gonna sing it to you)
You are the four seasons of my life
But maybe tomorrow you'll change your mind girl
Maybe tomorrow you'll come back to my arms girl
Maybe she'll come

Oh, you are the book that I read each day (Sing it, sing it, sing it, yeah)
You are the song that I sing (Sing it, sing it, sing it, yeah)
You are the four seasons of my life
But maybe tomorrow you'll change your mind girl
Maybe tomorrow you'll come back to my arms girl
You are the book that I read each day, yeah
You are the song that I sing (Gonna sing it to you)
You are the four seasons of my life
But maybe tomorrow you'll change your mind girl
Maybe tomorrow you'll come back to my arms girl
(Oh) oh (Baby) baby I need you (Listen to me girl)
You are the song that I sing
You are the four seasons of my life
But maybe tomorrow you'll change your mind girl
Maybe tomorrow you'll come back to my arms girl
