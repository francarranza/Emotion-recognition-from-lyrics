I think I'm going to be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The boy that's driving me mad
Is going away

He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
And he don't care

He said that living with me
Was bringing him down, yeah
He would never be free
When I was around

He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
And he don't care

Don't know why he's riding so high
He ought to do right, he ought to do right by me
'Fore he gets to saying goodbye
He ought to do right, he ought to do right by me

I think I'm going to be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The boy that's driving me mad
Is going away

Oh, he's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
And he don't care, don't care

Think I'm going to be sad
Think I'm going to be sad
Think I'm going to be sad
Think I'm going to be sad
Think I'm going to be sad
Think I'm going to be sad
