Your love's contagious, one kiss is dangerous
But I have more to risk, than you to lose
I feel passion growing, I know that love is only
Just one inch away, from striking us

We live for love, we live for love

When we get tired and watch the summer fade away
Will you think of romance, what will we do?
Is there a place where we can go?
Where time stands still for those who know?
Till eternity, we'll fulfill our desires

We live for love, we live for love
We live for love, we live for love

I never planned to win the race
But you convinced me face to face
There was never a chance of losing at all

We live for love, we live for love
We live for love, we live for love
We live for love, we live for love
(To fade)
