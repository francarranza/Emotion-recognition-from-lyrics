I built my wall
You walked right through it
I threw my stone
You leaned into it

You were the only one to show me hell
You rescued my soul, shattered my shell
You were the only spot not petrified
Said the right things at the right time

You love me, love me, love me
You love me, love me, love me, love me now

You light my fuse
I won't blow it
And these games you use
Do you think I don't know it?

You were the only one to show me hell
You rescued my soul, shattered my shell
You were the only spot not petrified
Said the right things at the right time

You love me, love me, love me
You love me, love me, love me, love me now
Love me, love me now

My eyes don't belong, across from your stare
I'm not going home, and you're not going anywhere

You love me, love me, love me
You love me, love me, love me, love me now

You love me, love me, love me
You love me, love me, love me, love me now

Love me now
Love me now
Love me now
Love me now
