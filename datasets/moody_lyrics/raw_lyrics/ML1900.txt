When you're here
I long for all those things
My eyes would steal like a thief and hide from you

When it rains
On this town and in this heart
I betray the ones I've come to love the most

When I'm down
And most of all I've had
Has come to get revenge on all I've done

But I'm sad

And our love is far behind
I long for all that time I spent with you

When I'm gone
Like a raven in the grave
Young lovers sure won't spring from these evil seeds

Play with fire
Play with you sometimes
