Only love can break a heart, only love can mend it again

Last night I hurt you but darlin' remember this
Only love can break a heart, only love can mend it again, mm, mm

You know I'm sorry, I'll prove it with just one kiss
Only love can break a heart, only love can mend it agai-ain 

Give me a chance to make up for the harm I've done
Try to forgive me and let's keep the two of us one.

Please let me hold you and love you for always and always

Only love can break a heart only love can mend it agai-ain
Only love can break a heart only love can mend it again
