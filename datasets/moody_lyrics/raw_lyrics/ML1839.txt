Blue skies
Smiling at me
Nothing but
Blue skies
Do I see

Bluebirds
Singing a song
Nothing but
Bluebirds
All day long

Never saw the sun
Shining so bright
Never saw things
Going so right
Noticing the days
Hurryng by
When you're in love
My how the fly

Blue days
All of them gone
Nothing but
Blue skies
From now on
