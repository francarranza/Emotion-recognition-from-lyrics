Did you pick the wrong one
Did he break your heart
He started acting crazy
When you wanted to part

He left some scars on your face
And bruised your grace with friends
It will be ok
The lonely one is here

Did you pick the wrong one
Confused you with his smile
Tricked you with his letters
And his fancy style

He pushed a ring on you
Before you knew
You're isolated now
It will be ok
The lonely one is here
Oh the lonely one is here

You're not just meant to wait it out
Be patient until he figures it out
He ought to know the obvious
Girl, that you're, you're so marvellous
He asks some questions of love
That you answered long ago
Does he care for you, I don't know
But I wish you, I wish you let, let it go
It will be ok, the lonely one is here
Oh the lonely one is here

Did you pick the wrong one
Did you pick the wrong one
The wrong one
