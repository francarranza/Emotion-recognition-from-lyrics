Girl you just don't know
Last night was incredible. Listen. Check it out.

Last night, I felt the skies open up and rain down heaven
Last night, I felt the sun, the moon and the stars come together
Last night, I heard an angel speak to me he said us forever
And while we were making love, I saw visions of a tropical river

Last night I
Touched a dream
When you were here with me
Last night I
Touched a dream
Girl you fulfill my fantasy
Touched a dream
Said we rewrote the book of love making history
Touched a dream
Last night you brought my dreams to reality

Now last night, I could have sworn I saw an eagle spread his wings
Last night, I heard a massive choir lift their voice and sing
Last night, I saw the world living in peace and harmony
While we were making love, I felt my soul being set free

Last night I
Touched a dream
You were here with me
Last night I
Touched a dream
And you fulfill my fantasy
Touched a dream
I said we rewrote the book of love making history
Touched a dream
Ooh yeah, girl you brought my dreams to reality

After the rain comes the rainbow
The sun will shine after the storm
Oh yes it will and Mother Nature guarantees
Jumped the mountain and touched the sky
Over the sea baby we can fly
When we made love I see the flowers the trees the birds the bees

Last night I touched a dream girl
Touched a dream
You right here with me
Touched a dream
Oh oh ooh a dream
Touched a dream
You fulfill my fantasy oh baby yes you did
Touched a dream
And baby we rewrote the book of love making history yeah yeah
Touched a dream
Girl, you brought my dreams to a reality yeah hey
Last night when you were lying next to me
Touched a dream
You fulfill my fantasy
Touched a dream
Yeah

And baby we rewrote the book of love making history
Touched a dream
Forever I have a dream
A vision of you right there with me
I know you're my love making queen
Touched a dream
And I am your love making king
Let no man or woman come between
What God has given you and me
Touched a dream
The laws of reciprocity
And give those amorocity (bootlegged form the word amorist)
Provided us with food to eat
Touched a dream
Fills our vacancies but together the perfect chemistry
Forever anniversaries
Touched a dream
You're the root to my tree, I'm a branch you're a leaf
The apple carrying my seed
Touched a dream
Fall, winter, summer, spring
That's why I ain't gon' let the devil steal my joy from me 'cause I done
Touched a dream
Touched a dream
Touched a dream
