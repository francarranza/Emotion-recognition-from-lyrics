Been in love so many times before
Everyone I loved walked right out the door
But I never knew
That I'd find someone like you

Take me by my hand
Help me to stand
I never knew that I'd find someone like you

Give me unconditional love
Unconditional love
Give me unconditional love
Give me unconditional love
That holy unconditional love
Give me unconditional love

Been in love so many times before
Everyone I loved walked right out the door
But I never knew
That I'd find someone like you

Take me by my hand
Help me to stand
I never knew that I'd find someone like you

Give me unconditional love
Give me unconditional love
Give me unconditional love
Yeah, that's all I want is your unconditional love
Give me unconditional love
Lord I love you, yes I do
Give me unconditional love

You love me right, God knows you love me right
You hold me tight
Lord, I love you
Lord, I love you

You love me right, can't nobody do me like you
You hold me tight
Lord, I love you with my whole heart
Lord, I love you

You love me right
You hold me tight
Lord, I love you
Lord, I love you
