People making lists, buying special gifts,
Taking time to be kind to one and all.
It's that time of year when good friends are near,
And you wish you could give more than just presents from a store.

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day
Even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would bring
Him love on Christmas Day,
No greater gift is there than love.

People you don't know smile and nod hello,
Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy.
It's that once of year when the world's sincere,
And you'd like to find a way to show the things that words can't say.

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?
The man on the street and the couple upstairs
All need to know there's someone who cares.
Give love on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love.

What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs more love.

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day
Every little child on Santa's knee
Has room for your love underneath his tree
Give love on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love.

What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs more love.
