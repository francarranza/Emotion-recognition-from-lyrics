If you think you can well, come on man
I was a Green Beret in Vietnam
I said no more of your fairy stories
'Cause I got my other worries

Fifty-Third and Third
Standing on the street
Fifth-Third and Third
I'm trying to turn a trick
Fifth-Third and Third
You're the one they never pick
Fifth-Third and Third
Don't it make you feel sick?

If you think you can well, come on man

Fifth-Third and Third
Standing on the street
Fifth-Third and Third
I'm trying to turn a trick
Fifth-Third and Third
You're the one they never pick
Fifth-Third and Third
Don't it make you feel sick?

Then I took out my razor blade
Then I did what God forbade
Now the cops are after me
But I proved that I am no sissy

Fifth-Third and Third
Standing on the street
Fifth-Third and Third
I'm trying to turn a trick
Fifth-Third and Third
You're the one they never pick
Fifth-Third and Third
Don't it make you feel sick?
