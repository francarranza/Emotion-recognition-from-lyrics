Somebody somewhere
In the heat of the night
Looking pretty dangerous
Running out of patience

Tonight in the city
You won't find any pity
Hearts are being twisted
Another lover cheated, cheated

In the bars and the cafes, passion
In the streets and the alleys, passion
A lot of pretending, passion
Everybody searching, passion

Once in love you're never out of danger
One hot night spent with a stranger
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to yeah
Passion, passion
Passion, passion

New York, Moscow, passion
Hong Kong, Tokyo, passion
Paris and Bangkok, passion
A lotta people ain't got, passion

Hear it in the radio, passion
Read it in the papers, passion
Hear it in the churches, passion
See it in the school yards, passion

Once in love you're never out of danger
One hot night spent with a stranger
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to yeah
Once in love you're never out of danger
One hot night spent with a stranger
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to yeah

Alone in your bed at night, passion
It's half past midnight, passion
As you turn out your sidelight, passion
Something ain't right, passion

There's no passion, there's no passion
There's no passion, I need passion
You need passion, We need passion
Can't live without passion
Won't live without passion
Can't live without passion

Even the president needs passion
Everybody I know needs some passion
Some people die and kill for passion
Nobody admits they need passion
Some people are scared of passion
Yeah passion
