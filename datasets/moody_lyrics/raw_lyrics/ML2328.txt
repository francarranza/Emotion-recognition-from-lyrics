The darkness bleeds its violent sighs
And purges from within
Death, it holds you in its arms
And kisses you goodnight

Oh, oh, oh the darkness comes
Oh, oh, oh I feel its bite
It purges from within

It's over, it's over this haunting is over
They cut my wrists and watch me bleed
Inside a dream
And over, and over this haunting is over
They cut my wrists and watch me bleed
They stop haunting me

Darkness bleeds its violent sighs
And purges from within
Death it holds you in its arms
And kisses you goodnight
