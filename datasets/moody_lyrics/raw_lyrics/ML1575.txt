Somewhere, there's a love just for me
Somewhere, there's a love just for me

Though I've been hurt before
It doesn't mean I never try anymore
To find that one girl I've been searching for
And she'll be just right for me
In love we're gonna be, forever

Somewhere
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
There's a love just for me
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)

I'm looking, baby
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
And I'm gonna find you
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)

They say that true love comes just once
I dreamed that when it comes
I'll really know how true love feels
And I won't let go
She'll be all mine till the end of time, forever

(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
There's a love, hey baby
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
A love just for me

(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
I'm gonna look and look and look
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
I know there's got to be a girl

(Looking everywhere, trying to find someone who cares)
For me, somewhere
(Looking everywhere, trying to find someone who cares)
I can just see myself holding her close
(Looking everywhere, trying to find someone who cares)

So close
(Looking everywhere, trying to find someone who cares)
And she'll be mine, all mine

I know, happy, I will be
Just my girl and me
In love, I know, somewhere

(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
There's a love for me
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
And I'm gonna' find it

(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
She may be just around the corner
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
But I'm gonna find her

(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
Somewhere
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
Somewhere

(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
Somewhere
(Somewhere, there's a love just for me)
Somewhere

Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere
There's a love
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere
There's a love
