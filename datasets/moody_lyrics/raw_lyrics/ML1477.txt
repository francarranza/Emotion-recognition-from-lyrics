We've been living decorations
And I'm sad to say
To get another place we've 
Found seamless today
To get another place we've found seamless today
There was a shock in the arms and a death in the gutters
Just found out looking at a million windows
We have the right to decline construction

Tired of waiting for the cold to lift
No one wants to hear its such a crying shame
Tired of waiting for the cold to lift
