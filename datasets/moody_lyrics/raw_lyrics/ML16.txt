I was messed up, dirty as I could be,
I was on my way to hell;
But I heard the preacher,
Preaching the Word of God,
Confess your sins and repent.

I came to Jesus as I was,
Weary, worn, and sad.
I found in Him a resting place
And He has made, made me glad.

I asked the Lord,
"How could He love me,
I have sinned against Your will".
But He said, "repent and I will forgive you,
The question's who will you serve?"

You might be dirty, messed up inside,
You may even have lost your will to live;
Don't be discouraged, don't throw in the towel,
Confess your sins and repent so you can be like me.


Weary


Jesus
