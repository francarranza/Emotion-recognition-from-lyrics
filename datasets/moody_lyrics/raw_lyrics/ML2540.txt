This song's to all the people
With light in their hearts
And love in their eyes
You don't have to worry
When the mountains seem of infinite size

There is one who goes before you to calm the sea
There's a King who leads His people to victory

We are destined to win
We're surrounded by His love
And guarded by His power
Destined to win
Following the Lord until the battle's over
We are destined to win

We all get discouraged
When the pressures of life start weighing us down
We've learned that in His footsteps
Crosses in life must precede the crowns

There is one who goes before you to calm the sea
There's a King who leads His people to victory

We are destined to win
We're surrounded by His love
And guarded by His power
Destined to win
Following the Lord until the battle's over
We are destined to win

We've got to remember
It's our destiny to win the end
With Christ on our side
We are destined to win

We are destined to in
We're surrounded by His love
And guarded by His power
Destined to win
Following the Lord until the battle's over

Destined to win
We're surrounded by His Love
And guarded by His power
Destined to win
Following the Lord until the battle's over

We are destined
We are destined
We are destined to win
