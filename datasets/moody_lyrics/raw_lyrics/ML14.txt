Baby, when I'm wrapped up in your arms
It never rains
And I'm prayin' for more, more and more
Each and every day, oh, baby

We're flyin' high and no one can deny
They can't tell by the look in your eyes

That we got love, you got me
If I got you, baby, we got more than money
You are everything a man's been dreamin' of
Oh, we got love, baby, we got love, oh, yeah

And you know I love to see you smile, oh
And what you done for me
What you done for me makes it all worthwhile, oh, baby
'Cause you, you are my desire
And with the slightest touch
With the slightest touch my soul's on fire

'Cause we got love, baby, you got me
And if I got you we got more than money
You are everything a man's been dreamin' of
Oh, we got love, baby, we got love

Storms are gonna rise and winds are gonna blow
But it ain't no need to worry as long as we know
As long as we know

We got love, baby, you got me
And if I got you whole, we got more than money
You are everything a man's been dreamin' of
Oh, we got love, baby, we got love

'Cause I've been new, I've been around
But we won't let nothing, nothing shake the love we found
We got love, baby, we got love
Yeah, yeah, love, baby, we got love

I, I know we gotta, gotta, got, got love
Soon we, I need a little bit of love
Baby, we got, we got love
Oh, love, oh, love
