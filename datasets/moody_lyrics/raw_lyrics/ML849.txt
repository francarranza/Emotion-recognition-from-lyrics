Lord I'm five hundred miles away from home
Teardrops fell on mama's note when I read the things she wrote
She said we miss you son we love you come on home
Well I didn't have to pack I had it all right on my back
Now I'm five hundred miles away from home

Away from home away from home cold and tired and all alone
Yes I'm five hundred miles away from home

I know this is the same road I took the day I left home
But it sure looks different now
Well I guess I look different too cause time changes everything
I wonder what they'll say when they see their boy looking this way

Oh I wonder what they'll say when I get home
Can't remember when I ate it's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still five hundred miles away from home
If my luck had been just right I'd be with them all tonight
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home

Away from home away from home cold and tired and all alone
Yes I'm five hundred miles away from home
Lord I'm still five hundred miles away from home
