My father
Our father
I pray a little letter to you
Tried to send you a Christmas
The postman couldn't get it through
You're up somewhere in the air
Wherever your nights are, you may sleep
But I know you live in my heart
Where it's warm and your spirit keeps

I'm just a man
Plain simple folk
Of instinct good and bad
(I'm so bad)
Hate to think you created me
And I always make you sad

Are you up to healing for feeling
Believe me, there's no place to go
(Oh no)
If you're willing, my lord, pick me up and let me know

Keep me in my solitude
Help me deal with loneliness
If ever I become depressed
Touch me and I'll do the rest
Pull me from my wicked sin
Show me where I start again
My needs are beyond the words I say
My God will not betray

People never give up
You just never give up
People never give up
You just never give up

Our father
Our father in heaven
I pray a little letter to you
Tried to send you a Christmas
The postman couldn't get it through

Keep me in my solitude
Help me deal with loneliness
If ever I become depressed
Touch me and I'll do the rest
Pull me from my wicked sin
Show me where I start again
My needs are beyond the words I say
And my God will not betray

People never give up
Just you never give up
People never give up
Just you never give up
People never give up

My God will not betray
My God will not betray
My God will not betray
(Keep the faith baby)
