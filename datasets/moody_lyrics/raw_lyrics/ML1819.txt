Remember when we said goodbye
I wiped my tears, you didn't cry
We both said things we didn't mean
Reaching for the hope but caught between the screams

And I would try to calm you down
But you wouldn't listen
And now I find you're not around
And it's your love I'm missin'

Louder than love (louder than love)
That's what we were, we were
Louder than love
And we couldn't make things better

Louder than love (louder than love)
That's what we were, we were
Louder than love
And we couldn't stay together

If we could both go back in time
Back to the days when you were mine
We'd vow to try but who's to say
That the love we shared could ever be the same

Maybe someday we'll both learn
Just how fragile love is
The mind forgets but the heart still burns
As it longs for your kiss

Louder than love (louder than love)
That's what we were, we were
Louder than love
And we couldn't make things better

Louder than love (louder than love)
That's what we were, we were
Louder than love
And we couldn't stay together

Through the things that we said
And the tears that we shed
Love stayed (we never let it fade)
But the words went to far
We're both left with the scars of love

Now we must go our separate ways, my love

Louder than love (louder than love)
That's what we were, we were
Louder than love
And we couldn't make things better

Louder than love (louder than love)
That's what we were, we were
Louder than love
And we couldn't stay together
