Don't you love her madly?
A-don't you need her badly?
Don't you love her ways?
A-tell me what you say

A-don't you love her madly?
Wanna be her daddy?
A-don't you love her face?
Don't you love her as she's walkin' out the door
Like she did one thousand times before?

Don't you love her ways?
A-tell me what you say
Don't you love her as she's walkin' out the door?

All your love
All your love
All your love
All your love
All your love is gone
So sing a lonely song
Of a deep blue dream
Seven horses seem
To be on the mark

Yeah, don't you love her?
Don't you love her as she's walkin' out the door?

All your love
All your love
All your love
All your love
Yeah, all your love is gone
So sing a lonely song
Of a deep blue dream
Seven horses seem
To be on the mark

Don't you love her madly?
A-don't you love her madly?
A-don't you love her madly?
