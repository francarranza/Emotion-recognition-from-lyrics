It would be easier to take the wet from water
Or the dry from sand
Than for anyone to try to separate us
Or stop us from holding hands

'Cause I love you
(I love you)
Oh, I love you from the bottom of my heart

And what love has joined together
What love has joined together
Can't nobody take it apart

It would be easier to take the cold from snow
Or the heat from fire
Than for anyone to take my love from you, baby
'Cause you're my heart's desire

I really love you
(I love you)
I love you from the bottom of my heart

And what love has joined together
What love has joined together
What love has joined together
Can't nobody take it apart

Even if they separate us
A thousand miles apart
We will still be together
In each other's hearts

It would be easier to change
All the seasons of the year
Than for anyone to change
The way I feel about you, oh, I love you dear

I really love you
(I love vou)
Oh, baby, I love you from the bottom of my heart

Love has joined together
What love has joined together
What love has joined together
Can't nobody take it apart, baby

What love has joined together
What love has joined together
What love has joined together
What love has joined together

What love has joined together
What love has joined together
What love has joined together
