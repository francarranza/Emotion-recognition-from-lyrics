I force myself through another day
Can't explain the way today just fell apart like everything
Right in my face

And I try to be the one
I can't accept this all because of you I've had to walk away
From everything

And I'm afraid to be alone
Afraid you'd leave me when I'm gone
I'm afraid to come back home

Another sleepless night again
Hotel rooms my only friend and friends like that just don't add up
To anything

And I try so hard to be
Everything that I should never take away from you again
'Cause I heard you say

And I'm afraid to be alone
Afraid you'd leave me when I'm gone
I'm afraid to come back home

I cannot forget
I live with regret
I cannot forget
I live with...

I live through this
I can't see through this
I can't do this anymore

'Cause I'm afraid to be alone
Afraid you'd leave me when I'm gone
I'm afraid to come back home
Afraid you'd leave me when I'm gone
And I just wish I was back home
