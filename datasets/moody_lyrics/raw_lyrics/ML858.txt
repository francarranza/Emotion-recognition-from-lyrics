They say, in chess you've got to kill the queen and then you made it 
Oh, I do you
A funny thing, the king who gets himself assassinated 
Hey now, every time I lose altitude 

You took a town by storm, the mess you made was nominated 
Oh, I do you
Now, put away your welcome, soon you'll find you've over stayed it 
Hey now, every time I lose altitude 

So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded 
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune's faded 

The medicated state of mind you've found is over-rated 
Oh, I do you
You saw it all come down and now its time to imitate it 
Hey now, every time I lose altitude 

So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded 
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune's faded 

Come on God, do I seem bullet proof... 

So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded 
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune's faded 

So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded 
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune's faded
