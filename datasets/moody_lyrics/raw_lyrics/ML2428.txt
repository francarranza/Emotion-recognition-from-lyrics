Happy, happy birthday in a hot bath
To those nice, nice nights
I remember always, always I got such a fright
Seeing them in my dark cupboard with my great big cake

If they were me, if they were me
And I was you and I was you
If they were me, if they were me
And I was you and I was you
If they were me and I was you
Would you have liked a present too?
