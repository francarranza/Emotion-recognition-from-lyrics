I'm a spy in the house of love
I know the dreams that you're dreamin' of
I know the words that you long to hear
I know your deepest secret fear

I'm a spy in the house of love
I know the dreams that you're dreamin' of
I know the words that you long to hear
I know your deepest secret fear

I know everything
Everything you do
Everywhere you go
Everyone you know
I'm a spy in the house of love
I know the dreams that you're dreamin' of
I know the words that you long to hear
I know your deepest secret fear
I know your deepest secret fear
I know your deepest secret fear
I'm a spy
I can see you
What you do
And I know
