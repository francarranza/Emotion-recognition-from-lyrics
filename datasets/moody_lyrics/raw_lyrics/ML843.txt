Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

I could never see
What fate had planned for me
And then you came and made my dreams
Match reality

Maybe you can't see
All the things you've meant to me
But my simple fate is at the gate
And, girl, you've got the key

Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

It seems like yesterday
You and I first loved this way
But now I know how love can grow
With each and every day

As we lay at midnight's hour
And feel love's hidden power
So strong and bold as life unfolds
Its mystery to me

Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

You and me for eternity
In love we'll always be
Young and free and naturally
The way it's got to be

Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
