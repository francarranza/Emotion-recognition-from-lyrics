Something's wrong
Wrapped up in mourning for far too long
Sunken eyes tracing the pavement and crooked lines
Paint us with crosses and sleepless night

And hope to be free
We just want to be free
Hope to be free
Who's gonna set us free?

Overgrown
All our mistakes are deceives we've sewn
Is it time? I saw the stones rolling back their eyes
Holding their breath until they see the light

It ought to be free
We just want to be free
We just want to be free
Who's gonna set us free?

With our golden hair in silent sway
We'll be home when brother finds his way
With our golden hair in silent sway
We'll be home when brother finds his way
With our golden hair in silent sway
We'll be home when brother finds his way

With our golden hair in silent sway
We'll be home when brother finds his way
With our golden hair in silent sway
We'll be home when brother finds his way
