Hello!
Well, I bet you're surprised to hear of me
I'm so glad you picked up the phone
I guess I owe you an apology
But I've been taking some time alone

I need so badly to believe
You missed me like I missed you
There's so much mystery
But I'm gonna think I do

I need your love in my life
I need your love in my life

Know the difference between a love and another?
Is one thing I understand
Now that I see no one from the other
I know I can be your man

You need so badly to believe
That my heart would be forever true
Now you're standing right in front of me,
Reaching out to you
I need your love in my life
I need your love in my life
I need your love in my life
I need your love in my life

I need your midnight visitations
I need you soul confirmation
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I need your love in my life
I need your love in my life
I need your love in my life
I need your love in my life

I need your love in my life
I need your love in my life
I need your love in my life
I need your love in my life
