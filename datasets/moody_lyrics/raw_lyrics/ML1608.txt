Some folk built like this
Some folk built like that
But the way I'm built
Don't you call me fat
Because I'm built for comfort
I ain't built for speed
But I got everything
All a good girl need

Some folk rip and roar
Some folk b'lieve in signs
But if you want me baby
You got to take your time
Because I'm built for comfort
I ain't built for speed
But I got everything
All the good girl need

I ain't got no diamonds
I ain't got no gold
But I do have love
To satisfy your soul
Because I'm built for comfort
I ain't built for speed
But I got everything
All a good girl need
