You see this girl
This girl's in love with you
Yes I'm in love 
Who looks at you the way I do
When you smile I can tell 
We know each other very well
How can I show 
You I'm glad 
I got to know you 
'Cause

I've heard some talk 
They say you think I'm fine
This girl's in love 
And what I'd do to make you mine
Tell me now is it so 
Don't let me be the last to know
My hands are shakin' 
Don't let my heart keep breaking 
'Cause

I need your love
I want your love
Say you're in love 
And you'll be my guy
If not I'll just die
