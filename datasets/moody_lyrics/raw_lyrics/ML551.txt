Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...
Yeah, yeah

I remember back in school
When I first laid my eyes on you
I saw your smile and knew right then and there
You reached out and touched my hand
And two became just one person
And no one could have stopped our love affair

But lately we can't even see each other, no
Without acting just like distant lovers
We've even took to fighting under covers
What a shame, baby, who's to blame

Young love
Why you wanna grow old on me now
Young love
Why you wanna grow old on me now

Don't say goodbye my love, no, no, no, baby
Just one more try, young love

I remember promises
The way I'd feel when we'd caress
I can't imagine where young love went wrong
You said that you needed me
But where is the sincerity
I-I guess that with our love that too has flown

'Cause lately we can't even touch each other
Without acting just like distant lovers
We've even took to fighting under covers
What a shame, baby, who's to blame

Young love
Why you wanna grow old on me now
Young love
Why you wanna grow old on me now

Don't say goodbye my love, no, no, no, baby
Just one more try, young love

Do you remember the young love
Do you remember the love we shared
Do you remember the young love
Do you remember the love we shared (When love was new, baby)

Do you remember the young love
Do you remember the love we shared (And we were to sugar)
Do you remember the young love
Do you remember the love we shared (Listen to me)

Don't you think we ought to give it one more try
We've come too far to be saying goodbye

Give it on more try
Ooh, don't you remember, baby
Young love was much better
Ooh, my love

Why you wanna grow old on me
Why you wanna keep me in misery
Why you wanna say goodbye
Why you want to make me cry, baby
Young love, my love, your love

Why you wanna say goodbye
Why you want to make me cry, baby
I'm cryin', baby
I'm cryin', baby
I'm cryin', young love
I'm cryin', young love
I'm cryin', young love
I'm cryin', young love

Don't say goodbye
Please
