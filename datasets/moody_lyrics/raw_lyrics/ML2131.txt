I got a good reason for loving you
It's an old fashioned sign
I kinda get the feelin' like mmm you know when
I fell in love the first time.

Kind woman
Won't you love me tonight
The look in your eyes

Kind woman
Don't leave me lonely tonight
Please say it's all right

Remember once before you're hearing
The old folks say
Love's an ageless old rhyme
But now a days you know the sayin' depends so much on
The kind of woman that you find

Kind woman
Won't you love me tonight?
The look in your eyes

Kind woman
Don't leave me lonely tonight
Ah you say it's all right

Kind woman
Won't you love me tonight?
The look in your eyes

Kind woman
Don't leave me lonely tonight
Please say it's all right
