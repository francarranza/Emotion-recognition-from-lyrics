You search me, You know me
You see my every move
There's nothing I could ever do
To hide myself from you
You know my thoughts, my fears and hurts
My weaknesses and pride
You know what I am going through
And how I feel inside

But even though you know
You will always love me
Even though You know
You'll never let me go
I don't deserve Your love
But You give it freely
You will always love me
Even though You know

(Repeat all)

Yes you will always love me
Even though you know
