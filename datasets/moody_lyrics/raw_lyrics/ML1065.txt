Yo if you don't know what the world means to me
Things change and rearrange
Friends aren't friends anymore
People go behind your back to score or anything
Will we ever have peace
Some one tell me please

You know you will see on the block
Kids playin' hearin gunshots
Never phased by the crimes that they witness
Follow me and come and see how it got this way
Young mama right there
Don't be cussin at your kids right there
Put the right foundation right here (teach respect)
So they can be

Most high (most high)
Most high (most high)
Most high (most high)
Like an angel in the sky
Most high
Most high
Most high
Like an angel in the sky

Brother why act why you act that (why you actin' that way)
Call your girl woman out her name
Bringin' kids in the world unclaimed
You should know that don't make you a man at all (not at all)
Young father out there (listen up)
Don't abandon your seed out there (show we care)
Let's get one thing clear (for real)
Family should be

Most high (held high)
Most high
Like an angel in the sky
Most high (it's the most)
Most high
Most high
Like an angel in the sky

It doesn't matter where yu are
You're still a shinnig star
It doesn't matter where you're from (it doesn't matter where you're from)
Let's give love to everyone (start showin more love)

Hustlers put down your guns (put 'em down)
Self-respect is the best weapon
Spead love show your real value
Set a true example by starting with you
See them kids right there
Don't be shootin round them kids right there
Gotta show there is hope out here
Train yourself you can be most high

Yeah yeah ooh

Most high (most high)
Most high
Most high
Like an angel in the sky
Most high (ooh yeah yeah)
Most high
Most high (most high)
Like an angel in the sky

It doesn't matter where you are
You're still a shining star (most high)
It doesn't matter where you're from
Let's give love to everyone

Most high (most high)
Most high
Most high
Like an angel in the sky
Most high
Most high

Like an angel in the sky
