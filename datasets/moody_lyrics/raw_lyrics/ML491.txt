Never tears or sorrows came before me in my mind,
I had no problems, never a problem in my life,
Never a worry on my mind

All my days before today were happy,
And secure until your phone call,
You were tellin' me goodbye

Now I'm lookin' for another love,
I'm lookin' for another pure love in my life
And I'm lookin' for another love,
I'm lookin' for another pure love in my life

Now the wheel of fate has turned,
I'm worried 'bout the new love you've discovered,
He is a problem in my life,
I have a problem on my mind

Things you cherish most in your life,
Can be taken if they're left neglected,
Leavin' a problem in your life

'Cause now I'm lookin' for another love,
I'm lookin' for another pure love in my life, ooh,
And now I'm lookin' for another love,
And now I'm lookin' for another love,
I'm lookin' for another pure love in my life, ooh,
I'm lookin' for another love,
I'm lookin' for another pure love in my life
