I can't believe what u're doing 2 me
Just can't believe what u're doing
All of the lies you want me 2 believe
Who do you think u're fooling?

Lately you got me thinking
Oh, why go on?
It's all so plain 2 see
And I think we both agree that it's much...

Much 2 late (it's much 2 late) 4 goodbyes, oh it's much...
Much 2 late (it's much 2 late) 4 the lonely tears you cry

Nobody wins once the games all begin
Nobody's into u're thinking
Your masquerade is the card that you play
Drowned by the bluff you're bringing

No truth 2 your confession
When will it end?
U were once my only 1
But now the damage is done, now it's much...

Much 2 late (it's much 2 late) 4 goodbyes, oh it's much...
Much 2 late (it's much 2 late) 4 the lonely tears you cry
Much 2 late (it's much 2 late) 4 goodbyes, oh it's much...
Much 2 late (it's much 2 late) 4 the lonely tears you cry

Much 2 late (it's much 2 late) 4 goodbyes, oh it's much...
Much 2 late (it's much 2 late) 4 the lonely tears you cry
Much 2 late (it's much 2 late) 4 goodbyes, oh it's much...
Much 2 late (it's much 2 late) 4 the lonely tears you cry
