A thought that never changes
Remains a stupid lie
It's never been quite the same
No hearing or breathing
No movement, no colour

Just silence
Rise and fall of shame
A search that shall remain
We asked you what you'd seen
You said you didn't care

Sound formed in a vacuum
May seem a waste of time
It's always been just the same
No hearing or breathing
No movement, no lyrics
Just nothing
A sign that leads the way
The path we cannot take
You've caught me at a bad time
So, why don't you piss off?
