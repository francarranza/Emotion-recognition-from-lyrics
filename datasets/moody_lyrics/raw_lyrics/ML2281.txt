Keep falling in and out of love
In search for what I'm dreaming of
I long to find a love I'm sure about
That certain kind of love that moves all doubts

Keep falling in and out of love
Still searchin' for that special one
To whom I can give my love completely
And feel a lasting love so sweetly

Just when I feel sure love's here to stay
It seems to suddenly just fade away
Can't seem to find that everlasting love
That this heart of mine needs so much of

Keep falling in and out of love
Can't seem to find the lasting kind
It seems I can't find the joy I need
Love always somehow all goes wrong for me

Keep falling in and out of love
Keep falling in and out of love
I keep reaching out for tenderness
Touching a hand that holds emptiness

Well, I'm looking for a love that lingers on
Long after that first kiss is gone
That kind of love that keeps burning bright
Long after we've said goodnight

Keep falling in and out of love
In search for what I'm dreaming of
Keep falling in and out of love...
