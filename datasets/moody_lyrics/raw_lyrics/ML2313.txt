This fucking city is run by pigs
They take the rights away from all the kids

Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, no way

Walk down the street, I flip them off
They hit me across the head with a billy club

Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them

Nothing I do, nothing I say
I tell them to go get fucked, they put me away

Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, no way

Those fuckers are gonna pay
Those fuckers are gonna pay

I go to court for my crime
Stand in line, pay bail, I may serve time

Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, no way
