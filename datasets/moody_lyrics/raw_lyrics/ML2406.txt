Killing with flange and with tape and with hendrix and
Killing with flange and with tape and with help
I am the one who cannot ever see cause
I am the one who cannot help myself

Oh, you're so bored

Trying to grab it
And you think that you have it
And you're wanting to know it
And you're trying to show it, but
You can't have it
No, you can't have it
No, you can't have it
No you can't have

Killing with flange and with tape and with Hendrix and
Killing with flange and with tape and with help
I am the one who cannot ever see cause
I am the one who cannot help myself

One, two, three, four
Kick that fucker out the door
