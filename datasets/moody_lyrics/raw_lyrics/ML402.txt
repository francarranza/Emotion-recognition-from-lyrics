Out on the highway a lot of pretty girls go by
But none have been right
Up until today I would never settle down
But you keep coming around

And your love is a miracle
It's spiritual
Got here just in time-
Your love is a miracle
It's visible
Even to a heart that's blind like mine

Out in the wild life, a lot of people telling lies
Lookin' right in your eyes'
And up until tonight, I was always on the prowl
(But) now I'm settlin' down

'Cause your love is a miracle
It's spiritual
Stands the test of time
Your love is a miracle
It's visible
Even to a heart that's blind like mine

Anyone can see what you're doing to me
And everyone can see that you're everything I need

'Cause your love is a miracle
It's spiritual
Got here just in time
Your love is a miracle
It's visible
Even to a heart that's blind like mine
