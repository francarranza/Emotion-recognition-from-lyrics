Shake the ground (Ah, yeah)
Shake the ground
Shake the ground
Shake the ground

I've been waitin' while you've been livin'
How do I think get through to you
Oh, my body's shakin', anticipatin'
Tryin' to figure out the truth, yeah, hmm

Baby, I've got to move {Ooh}
'Cause I'm tired of watchin' you
And I can't slow down
Or keep my feet on shaky ground, woo, woo

Slow down (Slow, baby)
'Cause I can't take the heat (Mmm)
Slow down
Ooh, slow down, baby

Slow down (Can't stop the haeat)
'Cause I can't take the heat
Slow down
Slow down, hoo

Is this the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on
{Is this the part oh, no}
Is this the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on
{Is this the part} (Don't wipe your feet on me, mmm-mmm)

If you won't give me what I've been missin'
Someone else will have to do, oh, baby
Can I discuss how it's gotta be
You for me and me for me {Ho...}

Slow down (Hoo)
'Cause I can't take the heat
Slow down
Slow down, baby, hoo... ooh... yeah

Slow down (Ooh, ooh)
'Cause I can't take the heat
Slow down
Now tell me what you're goin' through (Don't wipe your feet on me)

Is this the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on
{Is this the heart, baby}
Is this the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on
{Ooh...}

Don't do this

Slow down (Slow, baby)
'Cause I can't take the heat, I can' take the heat
Slow down
'Cause I can't take the heat, I can't take the heat

Slow down (Come on and slow down)
'Cause I can't take the heat
Slow down
Ooh, slow down, yeah

Slow down (Woo, woo)
'Cause I can't take the heat
Slow down
Slow, slow down

Slow down (You for you)
'Cause I can't take the heat
Slow down
And me for me, yeah

Slow down
'Cause I can't take the heat
Slow down
That you move too fast

Slow down (Darling)
'Cause I can't take the heat
Slow down
Slow down, baby

Slow down (Darling)
'Cause I can't take the heat
Slow down
Slow down, yeah, slow down

Slow down (In the fast lane, girl)
'Cause I can't take the heat
Slow down
Anticipating love of you

Slow down (Slow)
'Cause I can't take the heat
Slow down
I can tell I need you now

Slow down (Girl, slow down now)
'Cause I can't take the heat
