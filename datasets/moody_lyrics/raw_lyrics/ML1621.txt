Water You turned into wine
Opened the eyes of the blind
There's no one like You
None like You

Into the darkness You shine
Out of the ashes we rise
There's no one like You
None like You

Our God is greater
Our God is stronger
God, You are higher than any other

Our God is healer
Awesome in power
Our God, our God

Into the darkness You shine
Out of the ashes we rise
There's no one like You
None like You, none like You

Our God is greater
Our God is stronger
God, You are higher than any other

Our God is healer
Awesome in power
Our God, our God

Our God is healer
Awesome in power
Our God, our God
Ooh, ooh, ooh

And if our God is for us
Than who can ever stop us
And if our God is with us
Than what can stand against

And if our God is for us
Than who can ever stop us
And if our God is with us
Than what can stand against

Ay, ay
Then what can stand against
Then what can stand against
Ay, ay, ay, ay

Our God is greater
Our God is stronger
God, You are higher than any other

Our God is healer
Out God is healer
Awesome in power
Our God, our God
