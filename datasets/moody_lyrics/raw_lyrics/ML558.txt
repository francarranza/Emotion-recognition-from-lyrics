Every time I think about where we were and where we are
Something that's unbelievable
We been building on the slow but to see it come together
It's like a dream's achievable

We had bumps along the way, quite a few surprises
But we held fast, dealt with all the compromises
Put our pride aside how we sacrifice so long
For something we could call our own

Every single brick and every single nail
Every single triumph and every single fail
'Cause the house of love that we live in
I know it's from the ground 'cause we built it

This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love

I used to think of all the things we've overcome
As just our history
But now I know that all the things we built together
Will be our legacy

The world will know that we were here
Our intent to stay sincere, our purpose and hearts were clear
Our babies will have babies of their own
And our love will live on for generations to come

Every single brick and every single nail
Every single triumph and every single fail
'Cause the house of love that we live in
I know it's from the ground 'cause we built it

Every single brick and every single nail
Every single triumph and every single fail
'Cause the house of love that we live in
I know it's from the ground 'cause we built it

This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love

Every step, solid rock as a foundation
And a roof made of hope for our protection
A room of opportunity driven by affection

And every room I put my heart
And if these walls they could talk
They would keep you up all night
Telling you the first day
We moved to our biggest fight

Make so many memories
So here's and extra set of keys
Love made it whicha share it
Whicha right here in this house

This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love

This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love

Welcome to making this house
People we entertain in this house
Our family in this house, our house [Incomprehensible]
You know, this house
