Got no reason now for goin' home,
All my reason's now, she's gone
Got no one there to talk to
And even though I know I ought to,
Got no reasons now for goin' home

Once I had every reason a man could want
For going home and makin' love, but now I don't
So I end up in here each night sittin' and thinkin'
Missin' her, hurtin' so, and drinkin'.

Got no reason now for goin' home,
All my reason's now, she's gone
Got no one there to talk to
And even though I know I ought to,
Got no reasons now for goin' home

It's so hard now just knowin' there's another
That she's out with him, knowin' that I love her
So I end up in here each night, sitting' and thinkin'
Missin' her, hatin' him, and drinkin'.

Got no reason now for goin' home,
All my reason's now, she's gone
Got no one there to talk to
And even though I know I ought to,
Got no reasons now for goin' home
