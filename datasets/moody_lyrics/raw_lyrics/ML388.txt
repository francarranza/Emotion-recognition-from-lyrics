Nothin' suffocates you more than
The passin' of everyday human events
And isolation is the oxygen mask
You make your children breathe in to survive

But I'm not a slave
To a God who doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave
To a world that doesn't give a shit

And when we were good
You just closed your eyes
So when we are bad
We'll scar your minds

Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight

You'll never grow up to be a big rock star
Celebrated victim of your fame
They'll just cut our wrists like cheap coupons
And say that death was on sale today

And when we were good
You just closed your eyes
So when we are bad
We'll scar your minds

But I'm not a slave
To a God who doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave
To a world that doesn't give a shit

The death of one is a tragedy
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of millions is just a statistic

But I'm not a slave
To a God who doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave
To a world that doesn't give a shit

I'm not a slave
To a God who doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave
To a world that doesn't give a shit

Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
