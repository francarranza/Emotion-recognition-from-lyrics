Joy, joy

Joy to the world!  the Lord is come:
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And heaven and nature sing,
Heaven and nature sing,
Heaven, and heaven and nature sing.

Joy to the world! the Savior reigns:
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

Joy, joy
Hallelujah

He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders, wonders of His love.

Joy, joy
