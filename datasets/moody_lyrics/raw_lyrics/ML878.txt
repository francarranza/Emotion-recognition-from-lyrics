Kestrel's breed
Looking further than I can see
Without tact to read
She'd take a shine to me

Beacon, don't fly too high
Beacon, don't fly too high

For all your time, playful crime in rain
Worth it being cold, roofing for the lanes
A lesson lost again
Lesson lost again

Keep haunting the bus with fees of favors gone
Cracks and sailors fast and await the sun to show
Won't tomorrow come?
Won't tomorrow come?

Kestrel's breed
Looking further than I can see
Without tact to read
She'd take a shine to me

Beacon, don't fly too high
Beacon, don't fly too high
