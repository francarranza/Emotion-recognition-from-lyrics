Glass of gin and a folding chair
Sitting out by the wading pool
Chlorine blue

Rush of wind passing over me
Restless nights
Restless nights
Restless nights

Chin up, cheer up
Chin up, cheer up
Chin up

Chin up, cheer up
Chin up, cheer up
Chin up

Chin up, cheer up
Chin up, cheer up
Chin up

Chin up, cheer up
Chin up, cheer up
Chin up

My love's another kind
My love's another kind
My love's another kind

Chin up, cheer up
Chin up, cheer up
Chin up

Chin up, cheer up
Chin up, cheer up
Chin up

Chin up, cheer up
Chin up, cheer up
Chin up

Chin up, cheer up
Chin up, cheer up
Chin up

My love's another kind
My love's another kind
