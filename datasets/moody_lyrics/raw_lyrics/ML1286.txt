It's good to be king, if just for a while 
To be there in velvet, yeah, to give 'em a smile 
It's good to get high, and never come down 
It's good to be king of your own little town 

Yeah, the world would swing if I were king 
Can I help it if I still dream time to time 

It's good to be king and have your own way 
Get a feeling of peace at the end of the day 
And when your bulldog barks and your canary sings 
You're out there with winners, yeah, it's good to be king 

Yeah I'll be king when dogs get wings 
Can I help it if I still dream time to time 

It's good to be king and have your own world 
It helps to make friends, it's good to meet girls 
A sweet little queen who can't run away 
It's good to be king, whatever it pays 

Excuse me if I have some place in my mind 
Where I go time to time
