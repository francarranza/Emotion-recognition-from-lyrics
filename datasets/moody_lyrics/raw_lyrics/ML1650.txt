Home For Christmas
Leaves are fallin'
December is callin'
Feels like that time of the year
Ooh and a chill in my bones
Got me thinking of home
And everyone I hold dear
If ever I miss my connection
Stranded and feeling alone
But no matter how mean
This hard road treated me
I always could find my way home
Don't you know

That you are in my heart
And I always come home for Christmas
We're living apart
We're so close
We're so far
I'll still come home for Christmas
It might be just for a day
But I'll still come home for Christmas
Oh how I wish I could stay
But the years slip away
I come home for Christmas
And I'll always come home

I see all the lights
Someone told me tonight
Putting the star on the tree
It's a feeling I know
I'll never let go
Like my first holiday memory
Sometimes we all miss our connections
We're stranded and feeling alone
But no matter how mean
This hard road seems to be
We always could find our way home
Cause you know

That you are in my heart
And I always come home for Christmas
We're living apart
We're so close
We're so far
I'll still come home for Christmas
It might be just for a day
But I'll still come home for Christmas
Oh how I wish I could stay
But the years slip away
I come home for Christmas
And I'll always come home

But no matter how mean
This hard road treated me
I always could find my way home
Don't you know

That you are in my heart
And I always come home for Christmas
We're living apart
We're so close
We're so far
I'll still come home for Christmas
It might be just for a day
But I'll still come home for Christmas
Oh how I wish I could stay
But the years slip away
I come home for Christmas
And I'll always come home
