And they called it puppy love
Oh I guess they'll never know
How a young heart really feels
And why I love her so

And they called it puppy love
Just because we're seventeen
Tell them all
Oh please tell them it isn't fair
To take away my only dream

I cry each night
My tears for you
My tears are all in vain
I hope and I pray
That maybe someday
You'll be back (you'll be back) in my arms (in my arms)
Once again

Someone help me, help me
Help me please
Is the answer up above?
How can I
Oh how can I tell them?
This is not a puppy love
(This is not a puppy love)

Someone help me, help me, help me
Help me please
Is the answer up above?
How can I
Oh how can I tell them?
This is not a puppy love
(This is not a puppy love)
