Rollin' down a long highway out through New Mexico
Driftin' down to Santa Fe to ride a bull in a rodeo
He's hooked on a feelin', addicted to a natural high
Don't know why it's appealin', all he knows is he's got to ride

He's addicted to danger
Ruled by passion and pride
To pain and fear he's no stranger
But his lust needs to satisfied
Hooked on an 8 second ride

Gettin' up down in back of the chutes makes that rosin burn
He's got his spurs on the heels of his boots, he's at the point of no return
Climbing over that chute gate he settles down inside
The tension's risin' but he can't wait until they turn that bull outside

He's addicted to danger
Ruled by passion and pride
To pain and fear he's no stranger
But his lust needs to satisfied
Hooked on an 8 second ride

Hooked on an 8 second ride
Hooked on an 8 second ride
