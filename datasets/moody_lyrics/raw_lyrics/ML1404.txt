Pardon me
I don't mean to waste your time,
I just need someone to talk to
If you don't mind?

Then the thoughts of loneliness
That tonight I guess I'm to just to weak to fight,
I can take the lonely days,
But I can't take these lonely nights.

Are you alone?
Tell me what's your name?
I just need someone to lean on
I'm not playing any games.

Well, sit down here beside me
And let me buy you a glass of red rose wine
I can take the lonely days
But I can't take these lonely night.

When I thought that I was strong
But the night can be so long when you need a friend
But maybe we could find a little piece of mind
Before the morning comes again.

Oh, pardon me
If it seems I'm holdin' on
Letting go, it just isn't easy
When your sleeping all alone.

Let's forget about tomorrow
Beg, steal or borrow
Hmmm. Just a little time
I can take the lonely days
But I can't take these lonely nights.

Yes, I can take the lonely days
But I can't take these lonely nights...
