I can't go a minute 'way from You
I don't wanna try
I can't go a second without knowin'
That I'm on Your mind

You're the reason I'm alive

I know that in my heart You are there
I can tell by what You've done You are there
When I open up my eyes, I see You everywhere
I know that in my heart, know that in my heart You are there

There's no way I'd go back 'cause I'll remember
The way it used to be
Living in the darkness, cold as winter
Prayin' for the spring

You're the sunlight in my life

I know that in my heart You are there
I can tell by what You've done You are there
When I open up my eyes, I see You everywhere
I know that in my heart, know that in my heart You are there

Yeah, yeah, You are there
You're the sunlight in my life

I know that in my heart You are there
I can tell by what You've done You are there
When I open up my eyes, I see You everywhere
I know that in my heart, know that in my heart

I know that in my heart You are there
I can tell by what You've done You are there
When I open up my eyes, I see You everywhere
I know that in my heart, know that in my heart You are there
