Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love

I want you so baby
Can't even get mad at you
What a thing
You really swing
And I feel so good it's true
You're such a gun
Make my lungs sigh
Breathin' in the air
Through lovin' you
I really know, child
Just how much I care
Give me your love

Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love

Preparing for tomorrow 
You do what you have to do
I'll share the weight
Whatever fate
Plans to bring to you
Don't worry 'bout no attitude
You just be yourself
Could live with you
In solitude
And need no one else

Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love, love
Give me your love
Give me, give me
