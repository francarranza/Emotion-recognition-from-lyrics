Good morning, Mister Sunshine
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
I see you every morning
Outside the restaurants
The music plays so nonchalant

Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman

Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman

Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman

Good morning, Mister Sunshine
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way

Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman

Lonely days (lonely days), and lonely nights (lonely nights)
Where would I be without my woman, yeah
(Lonely days, lonely nights)
Lonely days (lonely days), and lonely nights (lonely nights)
Where would I be without my woman
(Lonely days, lonely nights)

Lonely days (lonely days), and lonely nights (lonely nights)
Where would I be without my woman, yeah
(Lonely days, lonely nights)
Lonely days (lonely days)
