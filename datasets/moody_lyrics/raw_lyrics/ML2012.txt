I like that outfit, the zipper's pinchin'
But if you want it any tighter, we could cinch it
Dress up leather, wear every color
I'm going Rococo with sequins in the summer

So come
Twirl your dresses around
Lift your cotton socks on
And turn your cameras on now for the fun

While I light a fire in your new shoes
If you should smile, look so surprised
While I light a fire in your new shoes
Look out that your soles don't burn to the floor

I light the fire
I light the fire

Buttons are busted, we're decorated
We make an ornament with gold and silver plating
So what's the latest, we raise a fever
We're just all red inside, that's all to see here

Yeah, we're red inside, we're all red inside
And the leg bone's connected to the one in the thigh
We are red inside, we're all red inside
And the leg bone's connected to the one in the thigh

So come oh, oh, oh
Twirl your dresses around uh, uh, uh
Lift your cotton socks, sock, sock, sock, sock
Turn your cameras oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

While I light a fire in your new shoes
If you should smile, look so surprised
While I light a fire in your new shoes
Look out that your soles don't burn to the floor

While I light a fire in your new shoes
If you should smile, look so surprised
While I light a fire in your new shoes
Look out that your soles don't burn to the floor

While I light a fire
I light a fire
