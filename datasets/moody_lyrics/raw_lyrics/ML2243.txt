Wishin', hopin', for that old familiar feeling
That takes you miles above, yeah it's called love
Would you do it for me
'Cause I'm feelin' lonely

Prayin', hopin', and I leave the door wide open
I see you and you catch your spill
But come and sit by me
'Cause I'm feelin' lonely

Maybe I'm a stupid fool
Chasin' butterflies like you
On these days they seem so cruel
But honey child, what can I do?

Maybe I'm a stupid fool
Chasin' butterflies like you
On these days they seem so cruel
But honey child, what can I do?

Maybe I'm a stupid fool
Chasin' butterflies like you
On these days they seem so cruel
But honey child, what can I do?

Honey child, what can I do?
Honey child, what can I do?
Honey child, what can I do?
Honey child, what can I do?
Honey child, what can I do?
Honey child, what can I do?
Honey child, what can I do?
Honey child, what can I do?
