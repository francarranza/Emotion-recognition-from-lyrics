There's a big brown cloud in the city
And the country side a scene
The price of life is to high to give up
It's rather come down again
When world wide war's is over and done
And the dream of peace comes true
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eat that rainbow stew

When they'll found out how to burn water
And the gasoline car is gone
When an airplane flies without any fuel
And the sunlight heats our home
One of these days when the air clears up
And the sun comes shining through
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eat that rainbow stew

Eat that rainbow stew in a silver spoon
Underneath that sky are blue
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eat that rainbow stew

You don't have to get high to get happy
Just think about what's in store
When people start doing what they oughta to be doing
And they won't be booing no more
When a president goes through the White House door
And does what he says he'll do
I'll be drinking that free bubble up
And eat that rainbow stew

Eat that rainbow stew in a silver spoon
Underneath that sky are blue
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eat that rainbow stew

Eat that rainbow stew in a silver spoon
Underneath that sky are blue
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eat that rainbow stew
