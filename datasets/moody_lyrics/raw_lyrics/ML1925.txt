I've seen God in the sun
I've seen God in the street
God before bed and the promise of sleep
God in my dreams and the free ride of grace
But it all disappears
And then I wake up

Was it too late?
Was it just your fate?
There's a demon that waits at the garden gate
If you get past him maybe Lawrence and Phil
Will be waiting to take you to the ghost of rockschool

Everything hums
As the blue heart turns
And the blue girls dawn us when the sun goes down
A story tonight is from your solitude heights
I got a window on your constellation

Master I love from the ground above
There's the stars below as my memory flows
Every picture frame is beating louder than time
Every clock in the hall is bending slowly

She's in her tower
And she's beautiful, sure
The quicker you learn she has no soul to discern
At least no business of yours
You bear the vacuum of scars
She was put there to tempt you
Like the perfume of flowers

I've seen God in the sun
I've seen God in the street
God before bed and the promise of sleep
God in my dreams and the free ride of grace
I've seen God shining up from her reflection 

I've seen God in the sun
I've seen God in the street
God before bed and the promise of sleep
God in the puddles and the lane beside her
I've seen God shining up from her reflection
