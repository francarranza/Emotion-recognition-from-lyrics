Love came down at Christmas
Love all lovely, love divine
Love was born at Christmas
Stars and angels gave the sign

Love came down at Christmas
Love all lovely, love divine
Love was born at Christmas
Stars and angels gave the sign

Love will be our token
Love be yours and love be mine
Love from God to all of us
Love for plea and gift, a sign

Love shall be our token
Love be yours, love be mine
Love from God to all of us
Love for plea and gift, a sign

Love came down at Christmas

Love for the ten commandments
Love for the nine that crucified
Love for the eight that stood at the gate
Love for the seven who opened up to heaven

Love for the six that never got fixed
Love for the five that stayed alive
Love for the four that stood at the door
Love for the [Incomprehensible] children
Love from the [Incomprehensible]

Love came down at Christmas
