I got something to say
I killed your baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead

I got something to say
I raped your mother today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as she's spread

Ooh, lovely death
Just waiting for your breath
Come sweet death, one last caress

Ooh, lovely death
Just waiting for your breath
Come sweet death, one last caress

I got something to say
I killed your baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead

Ooh, lovely death
Just waiting for your breath
Come sweet death, one last caress
Last caress today, yo
Yo

Here in this place lies the key to your death
Touch it, see it
Here in this place is the means to your end
Touch it, feel it
Green hell

You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from it?
I bet you thought you really could

We're gonna burn in hell
Green hell
Like every hell but kind of green
Green hell, green hell
Try let me get back up there
Green hell, green hell
Feel it burning in your cereal
Green hell, green hell
Throw our fuckin' friends inside
Green hell, green hell
Gotta fuckin' pay and you must stay
Green hell, green hell
Cannot refill the torch of death
Green hell, green hell
Hell is reigning in your blood
Green hell, green hell
Gotta burn it all
Green hell

You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from me
I bet you thought you really could

Here in this place lies the key to your death
Touch it, see it
Here in this place sister won't let it in
Touch it, feel it
Green hell

You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
Did you run away from me?
I bet you thought you really could
You've come to this as someone told
I bet you never knew you would
Gonna bring
Green hell
