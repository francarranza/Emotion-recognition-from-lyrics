Even in my heart I see
You're not bein' true to me
Deep within my soul I feel
Nothing's like it used to be

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I should've known from the start
With my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I live my life the way
To keep you comin' back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see?

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I should've known from the start
With my heart
With my heart
Quit playin' games

Baby, baby, the love that we had was so strong
Don't leave me hangin' here forever
Oh, baby, baby, this is not a lie
Let's stop this tonight

Baby
Quit playin' games

Nanana...

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I should've known from the start
With my heart
With my heart
With my heart

Quit playin' games with my heart
Nanana...

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart
With my heart
