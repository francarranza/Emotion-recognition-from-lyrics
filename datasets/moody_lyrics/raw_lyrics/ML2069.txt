Over the range
The secret is what we became
Now only the secret remains

Don't settle on me now
The cover is blown with a touch
We go when they're asking too much

Got a history and its catching up
Crossed the nation like a rolling blackout
Got the mystery but it's not enough
Ain't a prison but you'll never get out

Realise
Staying over is your only prize
Now I know
Some forget...
But I don't

The road before us
We move on and never let out
The things we had whispered about

Back to the mirror now

There's nobody left to defend
Its here that my loyalty ends

Got a history and its catching up
Crossed the nation like a rolling blackout
Got the mystery but it's not enough
Ain't a prison but you'll never get out

Realise
Staying over is your only prize
Now I know
Some forgive...
But I don't

No delay
Get out today
Get out if only I could
Letting go
I could say no...
But I won't
