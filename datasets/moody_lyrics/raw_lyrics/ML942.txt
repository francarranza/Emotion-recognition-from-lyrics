If you can feel what I am feeling
Then the truth is just believing
You're my, you're my diamond girl

Diamond girl you make me feel
Like I'm on fire when you are near
You captivate me with your smile
Girl you make me get so wild
Ooh oh diamond girl
You're my diamond girl
Ooh oh diamond girl
You're my diamond girl

Diamond girl I'd like to know
If I am getting near your door
Which will only make me want you more
Ooh I feel it coming through your door
Ooh oh diamond girl
You're my diamond girl
Ooh oh diamond girl
You're my diamond girl

If you can feel what I am feeling
Then the truth is just believing
You're my, you're my diamond girl
Ooh oh diamond girl

You fit right on my finger
I'm so proud to have me in you
I persist to enjoy all your gifts
Repeat (1x)

Diamond girl where'd we go wrong
The love I felt was all along
Why did you had to leave so soon
I feel so lonely without love

If you can feel what I am feeling
Then the truth is just believing
You're my, you're my diamond girl
Ooh oh diamond girl
I'll always wear your diamond girl
You're my diamond girl

Diamond girl tu me haces sentirrr
Como estoy en fuego junto a ti
Tu me captivas con tu amor
Te quiero dar todo mi calor
Mi ni√±a de diamante
Si tu eres, si tu eres
You're my diamond girl
You fit right on my finger
I'm so proud to have me in you
You're my, my diamond girl
