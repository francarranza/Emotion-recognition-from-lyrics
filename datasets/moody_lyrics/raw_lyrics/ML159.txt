Meeting you
With a view to a kill
Face to face in secret places
Feel the chill

Nightfall covers me
But you know the plans I'm making
Still oversea
Could it be the whole Earth opening wide?

A sacred why
A mystery gaping inside
The weekend's why

Until we dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sound of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

Choice for you
Is a view to a kill
Between the shades
Assassination standing still

First crystal tears
Fall as snowflakes on your body
First time in years
To drench your skin with lover's rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die

Again we dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sound of broken dreams

Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
When all we see is the view to a kill
