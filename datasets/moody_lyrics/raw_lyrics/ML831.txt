What you want, honey, you got it
And what you need, baby, you got it
All I'm askin' is for a little respect when I come home
Hey now, hey hey hey, yeah now

Do me wrong, honey, if you wanna
You can do me wrong, honey, while I'm gone
But all I'm askin' is for a little respect when I come home
Ooh yeah now, hey hey hey, yeah now

Hey, little girl, you're so sweeter than honey
And I'm about to give you all my money
But all I'm askin', hey
Is a little respect when I get home
Hey hey hey, yeah now

Hey, little girl, you are sweeter than honey
And I'm about to give you all my money
But all I want you to do
Is a little respect when I get home
Hey, hey, hey

Respect is what I want
Respect is what I need
Respect is what I want
Respect is what I need

Got to, got to have it
Got to, got to have it
Got to, got to have it

Give it, give it
Give it, give it
Give it, give it
