There's blood on the gun
That's in your hand
And the murder in front of you
Send out the wolves
The King is dead
Little pills taking over

This means war
Did the sun just burn out
Leaving you all alone

Living in a wicked world
We're living in a wicked world
There's no way you will escape
No one ever gets away

Love was the fuel
That drove your sin
When the Majesty followed you
The witches dance
The night begins
And the heart's taking over

The Royalty won't wash away
It's his scent that's inside of you
Off with her head
The Queen, she screams
Little pills taking over

This means war
Did the sun just burn out
Leaving you all alone

Living in a wicked world
We're living in a wicked world
There's no way you will escape
No one ever gets away

Living in a wicked world
We're living in a wicked world
It's a wicked world
Will someone save me
Save me

Somebody save me
Somebody save me
