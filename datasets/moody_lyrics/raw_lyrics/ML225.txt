Uh
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack, uh
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack, yeah
It goes a-one, two, three

And it's just another bombtrack
And suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this
But I'mma drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down
Hand out some beatdowns
Cold run a train on punk hos that think they run the game

But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
So recall our downfall
And the businesses that burned us all

See through the news and views that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff for manifest destiny
Landlords and power whores on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite and then watch 'em burn

With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite and then watch 'em burn

Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn

Yes, you're gonna burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn

Goes a-one, two, three
Another funky radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
And now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts you hear and you begin to fear 
That your card will get pulled if you interfere ()

With the thoughts from a militant, militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite and the watch 'em burn

Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn

Yes, you're gonna burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn

Burn
Uh
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack, yeah
Uh
Check it out

Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Yes, you're gonna burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, ya burn, yes, you're gonna burn

Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Yes, you're gonna burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn
