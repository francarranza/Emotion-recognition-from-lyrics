As a tear fades away
And the dawn dries a lover's eyes
No more tears, they're all gone
Just believe it will always be

My heart in your hand
Knows that all this belongs to me
And like the child here I stay
While your heart sings inside of me

One dream of my live
One night in eternity
The wind whispered soft to me
And heaven stood still

One sigh of the dawn
Sweet instant of memory
One celestial rhapsody
And heaven stood still
