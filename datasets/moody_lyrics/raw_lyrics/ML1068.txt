On a starry winter night in Portugal
Where the ocean kissed the southern shore
There a dream I never thought would come to pass
Came and went like time slipped through an hourglass

You made love to me like fire and rain
Oh you know you got to be a hurricane
Killing me with kisses so so subtly
You made love forever baby
You made love forever

I ain't gonna let you go that easy
You gotta say you love me too
I ain't gonna let you go that easy
I'm gonna give it all to you
Portuguese love
Oh, won't you say it to me, say you love me baby
Portuguese Love
Say it to me, say you love me baby
Portuguese love
Say it to me, say you love me baby
Portuguese

All the nights we made love till the morning start
Then you put the song to me on your guitar
Was it so familiar calling soft my name (Teena)
Sunlight dancing slowly through love's window pane

You made love to me like sugar and spice
Hush my broken heart this must be paradise
Killing me with kisses so so tenderly
You made love forever, baby
You made love forever

I ain't gonna let you go that easy
You gotta say you love me too
I ain't gonna let you go that easy
I'm gonna give it all to you
Portuguese love
Oh, won't you say it to me, say you love me baby
Portuguese Love
Oh, won't you say it to me, say you love me baby
Portuguese love
Oh, won't you say it to me, say you love me baby
Portuguese

Amore, Amore Portuguese, say you love me, baby
Amore, Amore Portuguese, say you love me

Yo quiero ahora ser amor, I feel it's too hard to ignore
Say amore' Portuguese, you got to say you love me

You know that you felt good to me
From the first kiss to the last I'm trembling

You made love to me like no other man
If you please I'd like to go back there again
Killing me with kisses so so tenderly
You made love like weee
You made love forever
