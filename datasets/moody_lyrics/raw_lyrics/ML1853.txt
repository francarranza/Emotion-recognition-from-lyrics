I took her out on a February morning
Just getting over it and dealing with the mourning
I started thinking out loud
I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

My baby's flying off the edge of the road
She's saying, "I'm so sorry about that note."
That left me all alone
But I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

Somebody turn the lights on
Somebody tell me what's wrong
I'd be lying if I told you
Losing you was something I could handle

Somebody turn the lights on
Somebody tell me how long
All this darkness will surround you
'Cause I'm burning for you
Burning like a candle

Seven days since I've seen your face
Seven nights I have laid to waste
I'm burning out now
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired

I know we're hanging at the end of the road
We've flown too high, baby, swum too low
I heard her screaming out loud
I heard her screaming out loud

Somebody turn the lights on
Somebody tell me what's wrong
I'd be lying if I told you
Losing you was something I could handle

Somebody turn the lights on
Somebody tell me how long
All this darkness will surround you
'Cause I'm burning for you
Burning like a candle

Baby, baby, baby
All the things that you say
What are the things that you mean?
What are the things that you say, say, say to me?

'Cause you're a tragedy
A queen for his majesty
All these plans for me
Your kingdom is crumbling

You're a tragedy
A queen for his majesty
All these plans for me
Your kingdom is crumbling

Somebody turn the lights on
Somebody tell me what's wrong
I'd be lying if I told you
Losing you was something I could handle

Somebody turn the lights on
Somebody tell me how long
All this darkness will surround you
'Cause I'm burning for you
Burning like a candle

Burning for you
Burning like a candle
Burning for you
Burning like a candle
