Ooh

Another day has almost come and gone
Can't imagine what else could go wrong
Sometimes I'd like to hide away
Somewhere and lock the door
A single battle lost
But not the war

'Cause tomorrow's another day
And I'm thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain

It's almost like the hard times circle 'round
A couple drops
And they all start comin' down
Yeah I might feel defeated
And I might hang my head
I might be barely breathing
But I'm not dead
No

'Cause tomorrow's another day
And I'm thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain

Ooh

No I'm not gonna let it get me down
I'm not gonna cry
And I'm not gonna lose any sleep
Tonight

'Cause tomorrow's another day
And I am not afraid
So bring on the rain

Tomorrow's another day
And I'm thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain
Ooh
(Bring on, bring on the rain)
