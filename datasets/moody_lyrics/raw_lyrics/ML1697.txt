I sent out seasons greetings to all our same old friends
The tree is trimmed and in your favorite place
I decked the halls with holly, built a snowman in the lane
I sing, 'Jingle bells on a one horse open sleigh'

But white Christmas makes me blue
Every time I hear it play, I think of you
I remember all the good ones we knew
Oh, white Christmas makes me blue

I'm trying to be happy, I know you'd want me to
Being sad at Christmas time ain't right
I'm keeping our traditions, wishing you were here
On Christmas eve I still sing, 'Silent night'

But White Christmas makes me blue
Every time I hear it play, I think of you
I remember all the good ones we knew
Oh, white Christmas makes me blue
Oh, white Christmas makes me blue
