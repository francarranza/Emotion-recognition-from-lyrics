Slowly
I know
We are dreaming
Feeling

Destroy me
I am nothing
I am nothing
I am nothing

Slowly
I know
Without you
We are dreaming

I am nothing
I am nothing
I am nothing

Don't leave
I know
We are dreaming
Feeling

Destroy me
I am nothing
I am nothing
I am nothing

I am nothing
I am nothing
I am nothing
I am nothing

I am nothing
I am nothing
I am nothing
I am nothing

I am nothing
I am nothing
I am nothing
I am nothing
