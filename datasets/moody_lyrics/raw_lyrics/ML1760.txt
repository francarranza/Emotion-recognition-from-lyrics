This space is tight, I'm running out of air
And for the moment, you all can fit
This frenzied state has almost finished me
And I won't bide my time to see it blow

Driving now against the flow of lights and I can see the fault in every home
They can try to hold to creatures in at night
And My response will be angry fist and teeth

I'll fight you all

We'll tear down this place, she told it to him softly
Don't use your heart, it only makes you slow
I'll tear down this place, I've known it since she told me
Make sure to take everything they have

I'll fight you all
I'll fight you
I'll fight you all
I'll fight you all
I'll fight you all
I'll fight you all

We'll tear down this place, she told it to him softly
Don't use your heart, it only makes you slow
I'll tear down this place, I've known it since she told me
Make sure to take everything they have

Make sure to take everything they have
