You are so beautiful to me
You are so beautiful to me
Can't you see
You're everything I'd hoped for
You're everything I need
You are so beautiful to nobody but me

Such joy and happiness you bring
Such joy and happiness you bring
Like a dream you're everything, I I hoped for
You're everything that I need

And you are so beautiful
You are just beautiful to me
You are beautiful to me
You are so beautiful
You are so beautiful
You are beautiful to me

You're everything, I hoped for
You're everything that I need
You are how to explain, that
You are beautiful to me
