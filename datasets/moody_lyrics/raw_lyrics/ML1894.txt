I'm so hurt
To think that you lied to me
I'm hurt
Way down deep inside me
You said your love was true
And we'd never, ever part
Now you want someone new
And it breaks, it breaks my heart

I'm hurt
Much more than you'll ever know
Yes, darling, I'm so hurt
Because I still love you so
But... but, even... even though you hurt me
Like nobody else could ever do
I would never ever hurt... hurt you
