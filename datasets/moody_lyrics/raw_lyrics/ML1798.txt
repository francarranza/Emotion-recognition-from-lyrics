If you disrespect everybody
That you run into
How in the world do you think
Anybody's supposed to respect you?

If you don't give a heck
About the man with the Bible in his hand
Just get out the way
And let the gentleman do his thing

You're the kind of [?]
Want everything your way
Take the sheet off your face, boy
It's a brand new day

Respect yourself, respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot
Respect yourself, respect yourself

If you're walking 'round thinkin'
That the world owes you something
'Cause you're [?]
You goin' out the world backwards
Like your day when you first come here

You keep on talking 'bout the President
You won't stop at pollution, no
Put your hand on your mouth when you cough
That'll help the solution

Oh, you cuss around women
For you don't even know their names, no
And you're dumb enough to think
That'll make you a big old man, oh

Respect yourself, ah yeah
You ought to respect yourself, yeah
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot
Respect yourself, respect yourself, yeah
Respect yourself, yeah, respect yourself

What's happening to the world, yeah?
Nobody respects themselves
You ought to respect your name
You ought to respect yourself, respect yourself
Respect yourself, respect yourself
