What good is the dawn
That grows into day
The sunset at night
Or living this way

For I have the warmth of the sun (Warmth of the sun)
Within me at night (Within me at night)

The love of my life
She left me one day
I cried when she said
"I don't feel the same way"

Still I have the warmth of the sun (Warmth of the sun)
Within me tonight (Within me tonight)

I'll dream of her arms
And though they're not real
Just like she's still there
The way that I feel

My love's like the warmth of the sun (Warmth of the sun)
It won't ever die (It won't ever die)
