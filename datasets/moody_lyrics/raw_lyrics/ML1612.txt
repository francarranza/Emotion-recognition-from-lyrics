Good night, it's stroke time
Let's get paralyzed down both sides
Snake hips, red city kiss
And your black eyes roll back

Midnight organ fight
Yours gives in to mine, it's alright
And the fast blood hurricanes through me
And then it rips my roof away
With her fire heads
This is the longest kiss goodnight

And now I, I tremble
'Cause this fumble has become biblical
I feel like I just died twice
I was reborn again for all our dirty sins

And the fast blood, fast blood, fast blood
Hurricanes through me
And then it rips my roof away
With her fire heads
This is the longest kiss goodnight

Goodnight
And then I fall down
I stumble
And she said, she said, she said goodnight
