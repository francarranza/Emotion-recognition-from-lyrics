He'll start drinkin', and he'll start thinkin' about her
Again, again and again
He musta brought the jukebox cause those old sad songs they just won't
End, they just won't end

His old broken heart, it still burns with desire
Cause you can't put out an old flame
By pouring whiskey on the fire

And tonight he'll make a toast to her memory
And then he'll take another shot of a 100 proof of misery
And his old broken heart still burns with desire
Cause you can't put out an old flame
By pouring whiskey on the fire

His tears fall like rain but his pain just wont die down
Cause there's another blaze that's brewin
As he buys another round

He'll start drinkin', and he'll start thinkin' about her
Again
