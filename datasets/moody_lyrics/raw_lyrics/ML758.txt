Won't you come into my room
I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood
I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow
As it pours upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought
Iron Maiden can't be sought

Oh well, wherever
Wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you
No matter how far
See the blood flow, watching it shed
Up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead
