Shut me up with your long tube socks
They don't scream, "Hey, let's just be friends"
Look at both my inkwells brimming
I was much less understanding then

How many stars you think you possess?
How many in your butterfly net?
Build me a star in your forehead
You were so misunderstood back then

But I think I get you now
I think I get you now

This is me starring
In a stranger's nightmare
This is me starring
In a stranger's nightmare
This is me starring
In a stranger's nightmare
This is me starring
In a stranger's nightmare

Don't let the bathwater get too high
You will be a flood of porcelain
Lines clotted on the inside
It's digging hard into your tiles

And we're gonna flood this house
We're gonna flood this house

This is me starring
In a stranger's nightmare
This is me starring
In a stranger's nightmare
This is me starring
In a stranger's nightmare
This is me starring
In a stranger's nightmare
