I got mad at history
Picked it up and fell in love with everything
Men and pen and paper
Like the wind you let 'em in now they'll never leave.
Run from the gun don't be afraid
Run from the gun where the dead lay
Run from the gun don't be afraid
Run from the gun...
You were sweet as poison
Dried my mouth took me out and left me glad
You did me no favors
It was dumb and the last one that I ever had
Run from the gun don't be afraid
Run from the gun where the dead lay
Run from the gun don't be afraid
Run from the gun...
It was loaded with the pressure
Too much pressure to be measured
I was holding off the wrong and the right...
I got let down gently
Never even knew the end was on the way
Then I made my peace there
Opened eyes and my surprise it was a waste
Run from the gun don't be afraid
Run from the gun where the dead lay
Run from the gun don't be afraid
Run from the gun...
