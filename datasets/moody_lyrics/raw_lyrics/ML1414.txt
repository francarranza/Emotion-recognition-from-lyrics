Turn the scissors with open blades
All the darkness will burn
Recalling pictures of olden days
All these feelings return
If you're breathing you've been afraid
In the shadows remain
I'll be stalking you night and day
Till you share all my pain

Now we step into the fire

Beware you will pay
Ladykiller
I swear you will pay
Ladykiller

Bait the killer and lie in wait
Till the morning unfolds
Now he's feeding on my mistakes
And the trail has run cold
All the violence that fills the world
Leaving nothing for shame
This is when so much pain will call out
Such things I have learned

Hear my vow and fear my vengeance

Beware you will pay
Ladykiller
I swear you will pay
Ladykiller
