People making lists, buying special gifts,
Take your time to be kind to one and all
It's that time of year when good friends are dear
And you wish you could give more
Than just presents from a store

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day
Even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would bring
Him love on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love

People you don't know smiling out hello
Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy
It's that once a year, when the world's sincere
And you'd like to find a way
To show the things that words can't say

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day
The man on the street and the couple upstairs
All need to know that there's one cares
Give love on Christmas Day

Why don't you give love
To someone who needs right now.
N-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-na Someone who need it right now
Ooh
Ooh
What the world needs is love
Yes the world needs your love

Give love on Christmas Day
Every little child on Santa's knee
Has room for your love underneath his tree
Give love on Christmas day
No greater gift is there than love
What the world needs is love
Yes the world needs your love

Give love on Christmas Day
Everytime, everybody and Susie, too
Gives love everyday much as you
Give love on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love
What the world needs is love
Yes the world needs your love

Give love (Yeah)
Give love, give love
When you know somebody
When you knoe somebody who needs love (Give love)
What the world to give love
Give love, give love
No greater gift is there than love (Give love, give love, give love, give love)
What the world need is love (Ah)
Yes the world needs your love (Ah)

Give love (Ooh)
