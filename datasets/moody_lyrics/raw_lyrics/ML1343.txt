When I saw you at the discotheque
Send my vibe out to you
Then we met up on the dancefloor when
Said I'm gonna teach you, gonna teach you, teach you

Oh baby you got me going so insane I just don't know what's going down
Oh I try to get off my knees and try to fight fight those feelings, but I can't

Ooh baby you got me going so insane and I just don't know what's going down
And I try to get off my knees and try to fight fight this feeling, but I can't

Now that you're here I know just what to do
Now that you're here I'm gonna come come to you
Now that you're, now that you're, now, now, now, now
I know just what to do know that you're here I'm gonna come come to you

Oh baby you got me going so insane I just don't know what's going down
Oh I try to get off my knees and try to fight fight those feelings, but I can't

Ooh baby you got me going so insane and I just don't know what's going down
And I try to get off my knees and try to fight fight this feeling, but I can't

I don't even know what to do, do that
I can't help this feeling
Baby you got me going
I don't even know what to do

And I don't, and I do, even know, I can't help this feeling
And I don't even know what to do

I don't even know what to do
Ooh, I don't even know what to do
