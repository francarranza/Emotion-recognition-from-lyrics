Oh let us rise
Above the bones
Let us remember the memories
Filled with compassion
Not scarred by anger
No not blinded by the ashes of the past
My eyes have not seen it all
Yet in my soul I know
No conception
Is hidden there down below

I wanna go home
Take me home
I've got to go home
Take me home

We gonna rise yeah,
High above the flames
Our hearts open as the endless sky
No more deception
No more shame
Just a reflection of the natural high
Ah, do you remember that melody?
Ah, oh yeah, do you remember that song so free?

I wanna go home
Take me home
I've got to go home
Take me home

Oh let us rise
Above the bones
Let us remember the memories
No more afraid
No more alone
Let our spirits fly so free
In my arms
A little child wrapped tight in prayer
Safe from harm, oh yeah
Ever guided by jah jah fire

I wanna go home
Take me home
I've got to go home
Take me home
I wanna go home
So take me home, home, nah nah nah
You take me home, home, yeah yeah yeah
You take me home nah nah yeah...
