Sometimes you love me
Like a good man oughta
Sometimes you hurt me so bad
My tears run like water
Ya get me out
Not before your friends
When ya disown me baby
Until we alone again

Your love is like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw baby
Your love is like a see saw
Going up
Down
All around
Like a see saw

Sometimes you tell me
You're goin' be my sweet candy man
And then sometimes baby
Never know where I stand
Ya lift me up
When I'm on the ground
But as soon as I get up babe
You send me tumblin' down

Now your love is like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw baby
Your love is like a see saw
Going up
Down
All around
Just like a see saw

When I kiss ya and I like it
And I ask you to kiss me again
When I reach for you you jump clean outta site
Ya change just like the wind
That ain't right
That ain't right
That ain't right

Your love is like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw baby
You love is like a see saw
Going up
Down
All around
Just like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw baby
Your love is like a see saw
Going up
Down
All around
Just like a see saw
Yeah
