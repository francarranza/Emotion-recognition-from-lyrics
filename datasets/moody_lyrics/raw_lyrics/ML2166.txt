May the Lord, God bless you real good (2x)
Woke me up this morning, started me on my way
Let me see a dawning of a brand new day
Real good (real good) (2x)
May the Lord (2x)
May the Lord God bless you real good

I know the tempter tried to tempt you so
(Hold on till He blesses you)
He's busy trying to keep the saints from reaching their goal
(Hold on till He blesses you)
God has something good in store for you
If you'll be faithful in everything you do

Real good (real good) (2x)
May the Lord (2x)
May the Lord God bless you real good

Vamp
May the Lord bless you
Bless you, bless you

Ending
May the Lord God bless you real good
