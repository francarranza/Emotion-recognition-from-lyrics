I ripped your heart out from your chest
Replaced it with a grenade blast

Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate

The firefighters hose me down
I don't care, I'll burn out anyhow
It's four-alarm, girl, nothing to see
Hear the sirens come for me

You doused my soul with gasoline
You flicked a match into my brain

Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate

The firefighters are so nice
I remember you, so cold as ice
The flames are licking at your feet
The sirens come to put me out of misery, oh

You wave your torch into my eyes
Flamethrower lover burning mind

Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate

Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
