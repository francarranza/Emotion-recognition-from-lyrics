She's got you wrapped up in her satin and lace
Tied around her little finger
She's got you thinkin' you could never escape
Don't you know your heart's in danger
There's a devil in that angel face
If you could only see the love that you're wasting

I can love you better than that
I know how to make you forget her
All I'm askin' is for one little chance
'Cause baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you better

I'm gonna break the spell she's got on you
Your gonna wake up to find
I'm your desire, my intentions are true
Hey babe, I know in time
Your gonna see what you mean to me
So open up your eyes, 'cause seein' is believin

I can love you better than that
I know how to make you forget her
All I'm askin' is for one little chance
'Cause baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you better

I can love you better than that
I know how to make you forget her
All I'm askin' is for one little chance
'Cause, baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you
I can love you better than that
I know how to make you forget her
All I'm askin' is for one little chance
'Cause baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you better

I can love you better than that
I know how to make you forget her
All I'm askin' is for one little chance
'Cause baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you 
I can love you better than that
I can love you better
I can love you better than that
Baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you better
