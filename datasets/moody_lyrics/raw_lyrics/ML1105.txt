They can hate if they wanna
I don't care, yeah
I said, let them hate if they wanna
Goin' nowhere

They can hate if they wanna
Let them hate if they wanna
Goin' nowhere

All your friends keep sayin' you can do better
With somebody else
Sayin' I'm dangerous and you can do bad
All by yourself

Everybody got somethin' to say
And they don't even wanna see
While they're talkin' so badly
I actually make you happy

All that matter is us anyway
And I don't even give a damn
For you I'm a better man
So tell them what they want to hear, baby

Let them talk about us
(They can hate if they wanna)
I don't care
(I don't care)
No matter what they say about us
(Let them hate if they wanna)
We ain't goin' nowhere
(Goin' nowhere)

Everybody says you're too slow for me
And the life that I live
You ain't out in the club all night, you want to be the quiet part of my life
They don't understand how beautiful that is

Everybody got somethin' to say
They don't even wanna see
While they're talkin' so badly
I actually make you happy

All that matter is us anyway
And I don't even give a damn
For you I'm a better man
So tell them what they want to hear, baby

Let them talk about us
(They can hate if they wanna)
I don't care
(I don't care)
No matter what they say about us
(Let them hate if they wanna)
We ain't goin' nowhere
(I ain't goin', I ain't goin' nowhere)

Let them hate if they wanna
I don't care
No matter what they believe
Ain't goin' nowhere
(Listen, I think I'll say it again, say it again, say it again, say it again)

Let them hate if they wanna
(Oh, let them hate, let them hate on us if they want to)
I don't care
No matter what they believe
(It could be you and me against the world)
Ain't goin' nowhere

Let them talk about us
(They can hate if they wanna)
I don't care
(I don't care)
No matter what they say about us
(Let them hate if they wanna)
We ain't goin' nowhere
(I ain't goin' nowhere)

Let them talk about us
(They can hate if they wanna)
I don't care
(I don't care)
No matter what they say about us
(Let them hate if they wanna)
('Bout you, 'bout me)
We ain't goin' nowhere
(I ain't goin' nowhere)

Let them hate if they wanna
I don't care
(They can hate, they can hate on me)
No matter what they believe
Ain't goin' nowhere
(Ah, yeah)

I don't care
What they say about us
No matter what they say
What they say about us
