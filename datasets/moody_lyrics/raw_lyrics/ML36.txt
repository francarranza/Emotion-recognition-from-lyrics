Oooohooohoohoooohoohoohoooo

Where is the love, where is the love you promised me
Where is the love, where is the love you promised me

You said I could have all your loving,
And this I wanted it you'd give it to me,
Now when it's down to the real needing feeling,
You're hiding that love from me,

Where is the love, where is the love you promised me (got to know)
Where is the love, where is the love you promised me

You said I'd be the only one,
That you'd be giving your sweet love to,
But somebody must be getting your love,
'Cause loving me you just don't do, nohoo, no,

Where is the love, where is the love you promised me (you know I need it babe)
Where is the love, where is the love you promised me

Brigde: I'm waiting on your love now baby, where is your love?
I'm hurting for your love now baby, where is your love?

Babe, babe, baheeyby, baby, baby, baby, hoow where is the lohohooove?

Where is the love, where is the love you promised me (I gotta know)
Where is the love, where is the love you promised me

Don't tell me you back on your primising baby, I gotta have it, you know I need it,
You know I want it, I gotta have it baby, ohooow, eheeey

Where is the love, gotta know, ...where is the love, wooohooo
