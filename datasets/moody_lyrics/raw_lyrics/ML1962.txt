No one seems to be around today
They must've all gone off
Without me again
I think I'll head home

Maybe I'll find them
Gathered 'round my doorstep
Oh, to sleep
In a comfortable bed
I think I'll head home

No one seems to be around today
They must've all gone off
Without me again
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home

Bring me a day full of honest work
And a roof that never leaks
I'll be satisfied

Bring me the news all about the town
How it struggles to help all the farmers out
During harvest time

Well, there's someone I'd like to see
She never mentions a word to me
She reads 

I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home

Bring me a day full of honest work
And a roof that never leaks
I'll be satisfied

Bring me the news all about the town
How it struggles to help all the farmers out
During harvest time

Well, there's someone I'd like to see
She never mentions a word to me
She reads 

I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
