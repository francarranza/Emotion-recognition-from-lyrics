Wonderful you
The dope you are
And beautiful me 
Came for your party
Well lately I can't stop talking about you
And mainly I'm wondering why in the hell I left without you

Take heart
Because you're art
And you're loved
Not that only
Take heart
Because you're art
And you're loved
Just not only

Maybe I do 
Maybe do ya
Now think about me 
Coming onto ya
Or maybe I would if I maybe knew ya
And maybe you want me
Or maybe you want me to be it to you

Take heart
Because you're art
And you're loved
Not that only
Take heart
Because you're art
And you're loved
Just not only

Because you're art
And you're loved
But not only
