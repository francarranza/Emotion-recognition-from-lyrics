Tonight we drink to youth and holding fast to truth
Don't wanna lose what I had as a boy
My heart still has a beat but love is now a feat
As common as a cold day in L.A.

Sometimes when I'm alone I wonder
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?

Love hurts
But sometimes it's a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive

Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
'Cause without love I won't survive

I'm fettered and abused, stand naked and accused
Should I surface this one man submarine?
I only want the truth, so tonight we drink to youth
I'll never lose what I had as a boy

Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?

Love hurts
But sometimes it's a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive

Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
'Cause without love I won't survive

Without love I won't survive

Love hurts
But sometimes it's a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive

Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
'Cause without love I won't survive

Love hurts
Love hurts
Without love I won't survive

Love hurts
Love hurts
Without love I won't survive
