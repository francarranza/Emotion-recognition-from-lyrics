Can you feel your heartbeat racing?
Can you taste the fear in her sweat?
You've done this wrong, It's too far gone
These sheets tell of regret
I admit that I'm just a fool for you
I am just a fool for you

Here is where we both go wrong

Tonight's your last chance to
Do exactly what you want to
And this could be my night
This is what makes me feel alive
Makes you feel alive

Here is where we both go wrong
So sign me up and toss this key
'Cause for now we're living...
In this moment, and we both ignore the truth
It's all over, It's all over
I feel your heart against mine
So take a breath and close your eyes, rise

Your lungs have failed and they've both stopped breathing
My heart is dead and it's way past beating
Something has gone terribly wrong
I'm scared, you're scared, we're scared of this
I never thought we'd make it out alive
I never told you but it's all in your goodbyes
It's all in your goodbyes

Well look who's dying now
Slit wrists sleeping with the girl next door
I always knew you were such a sucker for that
It doesn't matter what you say
You never mattered anyway
It never mattered anyway

In this moment, and we both ignore the truth
It's all over, It's all over
I feel your heart against mine
So take a breath and close your eyes, rise

Your lungs have failed and they've both stopped breathing
My heart is dead and it's way past beating
Something has gone terribly wrong
I'm scared, you're scared, we're scared of this
I never thought we'd make it out alive
I never told you but it's all in your goodbyes
It's all in your goodbyes

Don't shake, I hate to see you tremble
Trembling you've lost your touch
Haven't you, I'm so addicted
So addicted

Your lungs have failed and they've both stopped breathing
My heart is dead and it's way past beating
Something has gone terribly wrong (gone wrong)
Your lungs have failed and they've both stopped breathing
My heart is dead and it's way past beating
Something has gone terribly wrong
I'm scared, you're scared, we're scared of this
I never thought we'd make it out alive
I never told you but it's all in your goodbyes
It's all in your goodbyes

I never thought we'd make it out alive
I never thought we'd make it out alive
I never thought we'd make it out alive
It's all in your goodbyes
