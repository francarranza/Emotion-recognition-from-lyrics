I know I'm losing you, I feel it all the time
And I know if I lose you, then I'll lose my mind
So lie to me, lie to me, make me believe everything you say
Just, lie, lie, lie, lie, I'd rather have it that way

Nobody told me you were cheating
Aw it's just a feeling I had
So if I'm right, you got to lie to me
Then I won't feel so bad

Because the truth would only hurt me
And that price is too big to pay
So lie to me, lie to me, I'd rather have it that way

Now you may think I'm foolish for saying what I said
But the truth could mean I'd lose you
So tell me a little lie instead

Tell me that you love me and I'll believe every word you say
Even if you lie, lie, lie, lie, I'd rather have it that way
