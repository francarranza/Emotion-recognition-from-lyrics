Baby, when I think about you, I think about love
Darling, I don't live without you and your love

If I had those golden dreams of my yesterday
I would wrap you in the heaven, but they lay dying on the way

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love, feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love, feel like makin' love to you

Baby, if I think about you, I think about love
Darling, if I live without you, I live without love

And if I had the sun and moon, and they were shining
I would give you both night and day, love satisfying

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love, feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love, feel like makin' love to you

And if I had those golden dreams of my yesterday
I would wrap you in the heaven, really dying all the way

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love, feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love, feel like makin' love to you

Well, I feel like makin' love
Well, I feel like makin' love
Well, I feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

Well, I feel like makin' love
Well, I feel like makin' love
Well, I feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

Well, I feel like makin' love
Well, I feel like makin' love, yeah
Well, I feel like makin' love, yeah
Feel like makin' love to you

Yeah, feel like makin' love, love
Well, I feel like makin' love
