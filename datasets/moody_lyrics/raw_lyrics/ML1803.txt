That dog had his way with me
Shake that dog out of the tree
That dog had his way with me
Shake that dog out of the tree

Shake that dog right out of me
That dog, that dog
That dog had his way with me
Shake that dog out of the tree
Shake that dog right out of me
That dog, that dog

That bird came at me with a knife
Told me she wanted my life
Shake that bird out of the tree
So that everyone can see
Shake that bird right of me
That bird, that bird
Shake that bird out of the tree
So that everyone can see
Shake that bird right out of me
That bird, that bird

That pig took everything I had
That pig made me feel so bad
Shake that pig out of the bush
Now let's give that pig a push
Shake that pig right out of me
That pig, that pig
Shake that pig out of the bush
Now let's give that pig a push
Shake that pig right out of me
That pig, that pig

Shake that devil

That dog had his way with me
That dog, that dog
Shake that dog out of the tree
That dog, that dog
Shake that dog, shake that dog
That dog had his way with me
Shake that dog out of the tree
That dog had his way with me
That dog, that dog

That bird came at me with a knife
That bird, that bird
Told me she wanted my life
That bird, that bird
Shake that bird, shake that bird
Shake that bird out of the tree
So that everyone can see
Shake that bird right out of me
That bird, that bird

That pig took everything I had
That pig, that pig
That pig made me feel so bad
That pig, that pig
Shake that pig, shake, shake that pig
Shake that pig out of the bush
Now let's give that pig a push
Shake that pig right out of me
That pig, that pig

Shake that dog, shake it, shake it, shake that dog
Shake that dog out of the tree
So that everyone can see
Shake that dog right out of me
