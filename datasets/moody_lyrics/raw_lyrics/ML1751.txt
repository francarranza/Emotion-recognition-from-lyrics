Nothing left to say
And all I've left to do is run away from you
And she led me on, down with secrets I can't keep

Close your eyes and sleep
Don't wait up for me
Hush now don't you speak to me

Wrap my hurt in you
And took my shelter in that pain
The opiate of blame is your broken heart, heart, your heart

So now I'm all by myself
As I've always felt
And I'll betray my tears to anyone caught in our ruse of fools
One last kiss for me, yeah
One last kiss goodnight

Didn't want to lose you once again
Didn't want to be your friend
Fulfill a promise made of tin
And crawled back to you

I'm all by myself (close your eyes and sleep)
As I've always felt (don't wait up for me)
And I'll betray myself (hush now don't you speak)
To anyone, lost, anyone but you

So let the sadness come again
On that you can depend on me, yeah
Until the bitter, bitter end of the world, yeah
When God sleeps in bliss

I'm all by myself
As I've always felt
And I'll betray myself to anyone...
