Honey white, honey white
Honey white, made a deal for some angel food
Honey white, honey white
Everybody told her it was sweet and good, yeah

Oh honey (4x)

She said you'll see me later, yeah you'll see me later
Will you see me later seemed all too soon
And then he smiles, he knows honey's coming back
Honey's going to want some more angel food

Devil made of honey (4x)

She said you'll get me when I'm old and wizened
And not a day before that
The devil said honey it won't be that long
Besides I like to see you a little more fat
Yeah I like to see you a little more fat
You know I like to see you a little more fat

Honey white, honey white
Honey white, honey white
Tell me how is your angel food
Honey white, oh honey white
She says it's sweet and good

Honey white, honey white uh 
Honey white, the sweetness starts to fade
Honey white, honey white
Thought you could get away
 
Poor honey (4x)
