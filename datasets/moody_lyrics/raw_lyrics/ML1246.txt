I see a mansard roof through the trees
I see a salty message written in the eaves
The ground beneath my feet, the hot garbage and concrete
And now the tops of buildings, I can see them too

I see a mansard roof through the trees
I see a salty message written in the eaves
The ground beneath my feet, the hot garbage and concrete
And now the tops of buildings, I can see them too

The Argentines collapse in defeat
The admiralty surveys the remnants of the fleet
The ground beneath their feet is a nautically-mapped sheet
It's thin as paper while it slips away from view
