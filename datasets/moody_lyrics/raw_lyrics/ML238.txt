It would be easier to take the wet from water
Or the dry from sand
Than for anyone to try to separate us
Or stop us from holding hands, 'cause

I love you, I love you from the bottom of my heart
And what love has joined together
What love has joined together
Can nobody take it apart

It would be easier to take the cold from the snow
Or the heat from fire
Than for anyone to take me love from you
'Cause you're my heart's desire, and

I love you, I love you from the bottom of my heart
And what love has joined together
What love has joined together
Can nobody take it apart

Even if they separate us 1000 miles apart
We will still be together in each other's hearts
It would be easier to change all the seasons of the year
Than for anyone to change the way I feel about you, I love you dear

I love you, I love you from the bottom of my heart
And what love has joined together
What love has joined together
Can nobody take it apart

What love has joined together
What love has joined together
