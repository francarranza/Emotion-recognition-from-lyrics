It's early morning
The sun comes out
Last night was shaking 
And pretty loud
My cat is purring
And scratches my skin
So what is wrong 
With another sin?

The bitch is hungry
She needs to tell
So give her inches 
And feed her well
More days to come
New places to go
I've got to leave
It's time for a show

Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

My body is burning
It starts to shout
Desire is coming
It breaks out loud
Lust is in cages 
Till storm breaks loose
Just have to make it 
With someone I choose

The night is calling 
I have to go
The wolf is hungry
He runs the show
He's licking his lips
He's ready to win
On the hunt tonight 
For love at first sting

Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane (Are you ready, baby?)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane (Come on, come on, baby)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

Rock you like a hurricane

It's early morning
The sun comes out
Last night was shaking 
And pretty loud
My cat is purring
And scratches my skin
So what is wrong 
With another sin?

The night is calling 
I have to go
The wolf is hungry
He runs the show
He's licking his lips
He's ready to win
On the hunt tonight 
For love at first sting

Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane (Are you ready, baby?)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane (Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

Here I am
