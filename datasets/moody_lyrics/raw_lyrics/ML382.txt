Moderation is masturbation
What is what
And what makes you feel good
All these things I think about
I think about
They always come unglued

Yeah
I got this thing
It's comin' over me
I got this thing
Its comin' over me
I got this feelin'
Coming over me
Yeah

This confusion is my illusion
Nowhere to look
But know where to find you
All these things I'm sick about
I'm sick about
They always come unglued

Yeah
I got this thing
It's comin' over me
I got this thing
Its comin' over me
I got this feelin'
Coming over me
Yeah
