GO! and I won't make love to you
And I feel the love feel the love la love.

Jailhouse gets empty.
Rudy gets plenty.
The baton stick gets shorter
Rudy gets taller

Can't fight against the youth 'cause we're strong
Them are rude rude people
Can't fight against the youth 'cause we're strong
And the rude rude people long, baby get now

When I was a youth in 1983 was the best day of my life.
Had the '89 vision.
We didn't fuss or no fight
When all the little daughters wanna be my wife
Like a vision it was playin' on my guitar on my guitar.
I had to be there. I had to be there. I had to be there. I had to be there.
When the rhythm was playin'. I know that I'm gonna be there, yeah.

Oh Bud Gaugh will be singing there and Eric Wison will be banging out there, yeah.
Oh and we'll be all singing with version with versions raggae
Version, version, version, version oh
Oh whoa ooh
What has been told to the wise and uprooted, yeah,
It's gonna be revealed onto babes and Sublime.

Can't fight against the youth. Right now them are rude, rude people.
Can't fight against the resistance. Whoa right now them are rude rude people.
We're gonna rule this land. Among children were gonna rule this land.
'Cause when that rhythm it was playin' on my guitar, on my guitar.
I had to be there. I had to be there. I had to be there. I had to be there.

Oh, when I was a youth, it was the best day it was the best day of my life.
Had the '89 vision. We didn't fuss or no fight
When all the little daughters wanna be my wife.
When that rhythm it was playin' on my guitar, on my guitar.
I had to be there. I had to be there. I had to be there.
I had to be there. I had to be there.
Had to be there yeah mmhmmm mmm oh oh oh oh oh ah
