Pretty bird, pretty bird
Why you so still?
Pretty bird, pretty bird
We've been waiting on you

You go west for the black setting sun
You go south to the white spirit world
You go east for those real green eyes
You go north walk the good red road
Pretty bird

There's a mirror in heaven
Pretty bird, pretty bird
There's a window on earth

You go west for the black setting sun
You go south to the white spirit world
You go east for those real green eyes
You go north, walk the good red road
Pretty bird

Some pity me, yeah
Oh, pity me, yeah
Stars pity me
For the blood of the pretty
The blood of the pretty
The blood of the pretty bird

Pretty bird, pretty bird
Who's starving you still?

You go west for the black setting sun
You go south to the white spirit world
You go east for those real green eyes
You go north, walk the good red road

Pretty bird
