Although my lover lives in a place that I can't live
I kind of find I like a life this lonely
It rips and pierces me in places I can't see
I love the rip of nerves, the rip that wakes me
So I'm dissatisfied; I love dissatisfied
I love to feel there's always more that I need

So come on home
So come on home
So come on home
Home

You're where you want to be
I'm where I want to be
Come on, we're chasing everything we've ever wanted
Replace you easily, replace pathetically
I flirt with every flighty thing that falls my way
But how I needed you, when I needed you
Lets not forget we are so strong, so bloody strong

Come on home
So come on home
So come on home
Home

Blue light falls upon your perfect skin
Falls and you draw back again
Falls and this is how I fell
And I cannot forget
And I cannot forget

Come on home
So come on home
But don't forget to leave
