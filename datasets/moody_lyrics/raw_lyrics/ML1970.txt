And she spoke words of wisdom
To the basement people, to the basement, many surprises await you
In the basement, people, in the basement

Out on the main streets, completing your mission

You hid there last time, you know we're gonna find you
Sick in the carseat, 'cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets, completing your mission
