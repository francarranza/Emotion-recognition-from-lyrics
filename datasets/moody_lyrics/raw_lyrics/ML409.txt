Take the ribbon from my hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Laying soft against your skin
Like the shadows on the wall

Come and lay down by my side
'Til the early morning light
All I'm taking is your time
Help me make it through the night

I don't care what's right or wrong
And I won't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
'Cause tonight I need a friend

Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
I don't want to be alone
Help me make it through the night
