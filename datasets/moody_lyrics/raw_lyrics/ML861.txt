I used to think that this was perfect
And wish that it was never ending
But those days are gone forever
It's something I'm not missing
There's a force there's a voice, in my head
Telling me to think
About the times that you were cruel and mean
And I don't care if you walk away
I'm here to stay and you need to hear

You make me sick!
But I love what we're doing here
You make me sick!
And I can't be the only one

You make me sick!
But I love what we're doing here
You make me sick!
And I can't be the only one

I have to take advantage, before the moment passes by
It's so hard to manage, the ups and downs of your life
Someone help, someone speak, before I start to scream out
Anything to break the silence
You're holding me back, confined by doubt

You make me sick!
But I love what we're doing here
You make me sick!
And I can't be the only one

You make me sick!
But I love what we're doing here
You make me sick!
And I can't be the only one

'Cause I need you
'Cause I need you here with me
When it falls through
And I'm down upon my knees

There's a force
There's a voice in my head
Telling me to think about everything
Last time I believed
Now I realize!

You make me sick!
But I love what we're doing here
You make me sick!
And I can't be the only one

You make me sick!
But I love what we're doing here
You make me sick!
And I can't be the only one

Sick! Sick! Sick! Sick!
You make me sick!
You make me sick!
You make me sick!
You make me sick!
You make me sick!
You make me sick!
You make me sick!
