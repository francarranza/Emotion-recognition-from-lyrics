I don't want another heartbreak
I don't need another turn to cry
No, I don't want to learn the hard way
Baby, 'Hello' Oh no, 'Goodbye'
But you got me like a rocket 
Shootin' straight across the sky

It's the way you love me
It's a feelin' like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, impossible
This kiss, this kiss
Unstoppable
This kiss, this kiss

Cinderella said to Snow White
'How does love get so off course?
Oh, all I wanted was a white knight 
With a good heart, soft touch, fast horse'
Ride me off into the sunset
Baby. I'm forever yours

It's the way you love me
It's a feelin' like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, unthinkable
This kiss, this kiss
Unsinkable
This kiss, this kiss

You can kiss me in the moonlight
On a rooftop under the sky
Oh, you can kiss me with the windows open 
While the rain comes pouring inside.
Oh, kiss me in sweet slow motion
Let's let everything slide
You've got me floating, you've got me flying

It's the way you love me
It's a feelin' like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, subliminal
This kiss, this kiss
It's criminal
This kiss, this kiss

It's the way you love me baby
It's the way you love me darling, yeah

It's the way you love me
It's a feelin' like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, subliminal
This kiss, this kiss
It's criminal
This kiss, this kiss

It's the way you love me baby
It's the way you love me darling, yeah
