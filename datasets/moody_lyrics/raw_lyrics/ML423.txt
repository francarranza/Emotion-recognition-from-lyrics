Oh little bird
Oh little bird I wanna sing like you
The whole day through
Oh little bird why can't I be like you?

Oh little bird
Oh little bird I wanna be that brave
And never save
My loving for some other rainy day

You fly away
When it's cold and you can't find another way
But you will sing and you will love until you find a place
You can stay
You can stay
And sing your little heart out till your dying day

I'll fly away
When it's cold and I can't find another way
I will sing and I will love until I find a place
I can stay
I can stay
And be as bold as you until my dying day

Oh little bird
Oh little bird I wanna sing like you
The whole day through
Oh little bird why can't I be like you?

Oh little bird
Oh little bird I wanna be that brave
And never save
My loving for some other rainy day

Oh little bird
Oh little bird now I will ne'er be blue
Because of you
Oh little bird now I can sing love true
