Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you 'cause
With the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Falling all over myself
To lick your heart and taste your health 'cause

With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Blood loss in a bathroom stall
Southern girl with a scarlet drawl
Wave goodbye to ma and pa 'cause
With the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl in
Autumn's sweet we call it fall
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl and

With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you 'cause
With the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
