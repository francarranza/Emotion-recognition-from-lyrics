There will be no darkness tonight
Baby our love will shine
Just put your trust in my heart
And meet me in paradise
Boy you're every wonder in this world to me
A treasure time will steal away

So listen to my heart
Lay your body close to mine
Let me feel you in my dreams
I can make you feel alright
And baby through the years
Gonna love you more each day
So I promise you tonight
I will always be the lady in your life

Lay back on my tenderness
Let's make this a night we won't forget
Oh I need your sweet caress
Reach out to our fantasy
Two hearts in the beat of ecstasy
Come to me boy

And I will keep you warm
Through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I will make you feel so right
And baby through the years
Even when we're old and gray
I will love you more each day
'Cause I will always be the lady
Always be the lady in your life

Always the lady in your life

Stay with me
Always the lady in your life
I want you to stay with me
Always the lady in your life
I need you by my side
Always the lady in your life
Oh yeah baby

Always the lady in your life
'Cause I love you, yes I do
Always the lady in your life
And I need you baby
Always the lady in your life
More than you'll ever know
Always the lady in your life
I love you baby

Always the lady in your life
And I've gotta let it show
Always the lady in your life
And I... I love you baby
Always the lady in your life
I need you baby
Always the lady in your life

Don't you see I love you boy
Don't you see I love you baby

Always the lady in your life
Always the lady in your life
Always the lady in your life
