I don't want to lose you
I love you as you are
I don't want to lose you
I couldn't love you more
Tell me love will remain
Though we may change

Who do you think you are?
Who do you want to be?
You're the only one that really knows
Maybe you'll be surprised
After your search is through
Then you'll find you'll find you've just been chasing you
Believe me I understand
The visions of your mind
But I'm so afraid that the man you find may not need a girl like me

I don't want to lose you
I love you as you are
I don't wanna lose you
I couldn't love you more
Tell me love will remain
Though we may change

I really think that you
Have little faith in me
You're the only one I'll ever need
If you really understood
How much you mean to me
All your doubts would fade and disappear
Maybe you'll never find
The secrets of your mind
But you gotta try
You gotta realize
And I'll help you all I can

I don't want to lose you
I love you as you are
I don't want to lose you
I couldn't love you more
Tell me love will remain
Though we may change

Maybe you'll never find
The secrets of your mind
But you gotta try
Gotta realize
And I'll help ya all I can

I don't want to lose you
I love you as you are
I don't want to lose you
I couldn't love you more
Tell me that love will remain
Though we may change
I don't want to lose you
I love you as you are
I don't want to lose you
Couldn't love you more
(Iiiii)
Love you as you are
I don't want to lose you
(No No oh)
I don't want to lose you
I love you as you are
