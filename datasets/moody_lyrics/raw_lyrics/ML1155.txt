I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you

Sittin' here with my tears
All alone with my fears, I'm wondering
If I have to do withoutcha
But there's no reason why

I feel asleep late last night
Cryin' like a newborn child
Holdin' myself close
Pretendin' my arms are yours
I want no one but you

I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you

I still remember to the day
In fact is was a 3rd Monday
You came along to be the one for me
And now I'm so all alone

I'm sittin' here by the phone
Called that say that your okay
So that I have
The chance to beg you to stay
I want no one but you

I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you

I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but

Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
You know that I know that I get so lonely thinking of you

I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you

I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you
