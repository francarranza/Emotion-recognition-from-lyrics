Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you

The fireplace keeps burning
And my thoughts keep turning
The pages of memories
Of time spent with you

Old Christmas songs we knew
And used to make love to
Make it hard to get used to
Christmas without you

Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you I miss you
So sad but so true

Christmas without you
Like a mystery with no clue
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you

The sweetest gift I know
Would be if the new snow
Could fall on your footsteps
On this Christmas Eve

The most joyous Christmas
If luck could be with us
Would be if Saint Nicholas
Brought you home to me

Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you, I miss you, I need you
So sad but so true

Christmas without you
Like a mystery with no clues
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you

Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you I miss you
So sad but so true

Christmas without you
I just can't get used to
I just have no use
For Christmas without you

You know that I want you
You know that I need you
You know that I need you
You know that I want you

You know that I love you
I need you
I want you
Oh, yes I do!

You know that I want you
You know that I need you
You know that I need you
You know that I want you
