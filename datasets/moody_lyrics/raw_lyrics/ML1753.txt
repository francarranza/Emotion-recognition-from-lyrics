Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen
You won't see another morning
You won't see another evening
Good night
Buenas noches oh señor!
Señorita see ya later
Buenas noches bye-bye
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is a joke
And for you we sing this final song
For you there is no hope
Sayonara oh suicide hari kari
Kamikaze you won't
See another evening
Goodbye
Bye-bye so long, farewell
See you later... Suicide
Suicide
Suicide
Suicide
