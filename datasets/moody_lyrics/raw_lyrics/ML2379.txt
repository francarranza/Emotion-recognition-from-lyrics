She watches movies but he don't
He watches football but she won't
They've got a lonely house to hold together

His Playboy pictures turn him on
Her heart's so cold and lonely stone
Get big on and on and on there together

Together alone, together alone
They're at the house and they're not at home
Together alone

No angry words that they'll regret
They're never fuss or fighting yet
Sleep side by side but seldom get all together

They wanna plod outside of time
With them the maples gathered round
Someday they'll lie beneath the ground there together

Together alone, together alone
They're not unlike so many I've known
Together alone, together alone, together alone
