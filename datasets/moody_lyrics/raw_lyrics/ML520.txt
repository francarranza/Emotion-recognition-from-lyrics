It's been a long year since you've been gone
I've been alone here, I've grown old
I fall to pieces, I'm falling
Fell to pieces and I'm still falling

Every time I'm falling down
All alone I fall to pieces

I keep a journal with memories
I'm feeling lonely, I can't breathe
I fall to pieces, I'm falling
Fell to pieces and I'm still falling

Every time I'm falling down
All alone I fall to pieces
Every time I'm falling down
All alone I fall to pieces
Every time I'm falling down
All alone I fall to pieces

All the years I've tried
With more to go
Will the memories die
I'm waiting
Will I find you?
Can I find you?
We're falling down
I'm falling

Every time I'm falling down
All alone I fall to pieces
Every time I'm falling down
All alone I fall to pieces

Every time I'm falling down
All alone I fall to pieces
Every time I'm falling down
All alone I fall to pieces
