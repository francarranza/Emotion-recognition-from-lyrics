Tonight we sail the wide low wind
Rolling her homeward with blood on our knives!
Who'd a known, you're a deviant sister
Guts on your blouse
You're worth your own weight
In diamonds - a dozen
Sailing to nowhere
Vapor to float on
Still we roll on through the night

Tattling systems trading in lies
Taken down by the hounds
One by one
Longing to find our way out
Following the ghost down

Running in circles
A mouse on the table
I try to feel but just don't
Curling and dead inside
"Go on and cut him in half" said I
