Bring all the family 
Take all the family 
Bring all the family 
See all the family 

Bring all the family out to the holiday 
While we're all still around 
Show you what the cats been doing, and how he gets around 
You can't wake him, he's not sleeping 
He never comes down 
Bring all the family out to the holiday 
While we're all still in town 
Show you what the cats been doing, and how he gets around 
Lady skin up, lady skin up 
Now that we live together we both get fucked up 

Bring all the family 
Out to the funeral 
Bring all the family 
Out to the funeral 

It's only grandbag that died 
He really couldn't see what you're doing 
And all his family were white 

Lady skin up, lady roll up 
Now that we live together we both get good luck 

Bring all the family 
Take all the family 
Bring all the family 
See all the family
