Birds flyin' high you know how I feel
Sun in the sky you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me
Yeah, it's a new dawn it's a new day it's a new life for me ooh
And I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River runnin' free you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me
And I'm feelin' good

Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean don't you know
Butterflies all havin' fun you know what I mean
Sleepin' peace when day is done that's what I mean
And this old world is a new world and a bold world for me

Stars when you shine you know how I feel
Scent of the crime you know how I feel
Your freedom is mine, and I know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me
(Free styling)
Oh I'm feeling goooooooooooood
