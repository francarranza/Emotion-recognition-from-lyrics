After the flames
When the fields are cold
And after the pain
When the heart is gold
You will find a brand new day
With the birds upon the wire
And all you really had to pay
Was the price of the fire

And in our younger days
You could say we were wild
In our hungry ways
The safety lines were filed
We were running on the rims
We were burning out the tires
And all we really had to pay
Was the price of the fire
Oh, all we really had to pay
Was the price of the fire

And the breakers of hearts
They don't escape pain
And you know when it starts
As you dive into the flames
And there's a voice that tells you run
But you call the voice a liar
For all you really had to pay
All you really had to pay
Was the price of the fire
Was the price of the fire
