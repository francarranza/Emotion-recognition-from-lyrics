Jesus our King kind and good was humbly born in a stable of wood
And the lowly beasts around him stood Jesus our King kind and good
I said the donkey shaggy and brown I carried his mother up and down
I carried his mother to Bethlehem town I said the donkey shaggy and brown
I said the ox this was my hay I gave him my manger twas here that he lay
I gave him my manger twas here that he lay I said the ox this was my hay
(I said the sheep with pearly horn I gave him my wool for a blanket warm
He wore my coat on Christmas morn I said the sheep with pearly horn)
I said the dove from the rafters high I sang him to sleep that he would not cry
We sang him to sleep my love and I I said the dove from the rafters high
And so every heart by some good spell in the stable dark was glad to tell
Of the gift they he gave to Emanuel of the gift that he gave to Emanuel
