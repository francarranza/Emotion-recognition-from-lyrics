Oh yeah
All right
Are you gonna be in my dreams
Tonight?

Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make
