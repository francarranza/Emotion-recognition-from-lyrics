Your sorry eyes
They cut through bone
They make it hard
To leave you alone
Leave you here
Wearing your wounds
Waving your guns
At somebody new

Baby, you're lost
Baby, you're lost
Baby, you're a lost cause

There's too many people
You used to know
They see you coming
They see you go
They know your secrets
And you know theirs
This town is crazy
Nobody cares

Baby, you're lost
Baby, you're lost
Baby, you're a lost cause

I'm tired of fighting
I'm tired of fighting
Fighting for a lost cause

There's a place where you are going
You ain't never been before
There's no one laughing at your back now
No one standing at your door
Is that what you thought love was for?

Baby, you're lost
Baby, you're lost
Baby, you're a lost cause

I'm tired of fighting
I'm tired of fighting
Fighting for a lost cause
