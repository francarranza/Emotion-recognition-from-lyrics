All your love, baby, can it be mine?
All your love, baby, can it be mine?
I'll hate to be the one, the one that you left behind

All your love, baby, don't you fool around
All your love, baby, don't fool around
Love is the one thing, baby, that you won't find on the ground

All of your love, I've got to have it one of these days
All of your love, I've got to have it one day
Don't you leave me sweet baby, please come one back this way
Come on back this way

Give me all your love
Give it to me right now
All your love
Don't mess around with my love
