We left our homes behind, now we're following the wolves' trail
Through the deepest forests, beneath the stars we ride
I can see the moon glowing red like the blood of warriors
There's a prophecy, that tonight many men will die
The fire will burn forever in our passionate hearts
Our destinies are calling us now
We are ready to take their lives

Into battle we ride with Gods by our side
We are strong and not afraid to die
We have an urge to kill and our lust for blood has to be fulfilled
WE'LL FIGHT TILL THE END! And send our enemies straight to Hell!

Prominent leaders, cast your swords in the wind as a sign of war
Men, prepare for death, 'cause we might never return

Blood will spill and heads will fall
As the swords sparkle, lights the night
The ground rumbles as we attack
In the throes of rage, we will fight
The lightning's flash, the thunder's roar
Will petrify the weak
We'll show no mercy, we'll kill them all!
We are sworn in the name of steel

Into battle we ride with Gods by our side
We are strong and not afraid to die
We have an urge to kill and our lust for blood has to be fulfilled
WE'LL FIGHT TILL THE END! And send our enemies straight to Hell!
Into battle we ride with Gods by our side
We are strong and not afraid to die
We have an urge to kill and our lust for blood has to be fulfilled
WE'LL FIGHT TILL THE END! And send our enemies straight to Hell!
