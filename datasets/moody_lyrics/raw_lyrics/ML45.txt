All right

My dirthouse, watch it happen from the box
Mind wanders, dirty, dirty word
My dirthouse, this is where it all comes down
Look into my eye, you feel my skin, it's dirt

Drive me wild, remember when you blew my mind?
Cut through me, living in the dirt
These dogs are curled up in a little ball
These dogs are freezing their asses off!

Go, go, go! Go, go, go!
Pick up the pieces
I wanna call this my home!
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!
Pick up the pieces
I've got some pain of my own!

Go, go, go! Go, go, go!
Pick up the pieces
I wanna call this my home!
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!
Pick up the pieces
I've got some pain of my own!

Open the box, see what's inside
You make the call, sick of it all
Open the box, see what's inside
You make the call, sick of it all

Tear me down, pushing on my every nerve
Scares me, I hope I don't get burnt
Look closer, look into my dirty mind
Feeling sick inside, my blood has turned to fucking dirt!

Go, go, go! Go, go, go!
Pick up the pieces
I wanna call this my home!
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!
Pick up the pieces
I've got some pain of my own!
