I've seen that look before
And I can't ignore, it's lovelessness
I see a change in you
Have you met someone new, I'm so upset

I used to think we were in love
And it all seemed so right then
But now I know that our love
Will not be the same again

Who's got your love
Now that I don't have it anymore
Who's got your love
Now that I don't have it who's it for

Who's got your love
Now that I don't have it anymore
Who's got your love
Now that I don't have it who's it for

Who's got your love
Who's got your love
Who's got your love
Who's got your love

Was it all up to me
To make our lives complete, you know that's wrong
Because it takes two souls
To fulfill the roles of love and war

What makes it right for you
To think that I was made of the heart of stone
And did you think that I
Would forget, now I stand alone

Who's got your love
Now that I don't have it anymore
Who's got your love
Now that I don't have it who's it for

Who's got your love
Now that I don't have it anymore
Who's got your love
Now that I don't have it who's it for

Who's got your love
Who's got your love
Who's got your love
Who's got your love
Who's got your love

Who's got your love
Now that I don't have it anymore
Who's got your love
Now that I don't have it who's it for

Who's got your love
Who's got your love
Who's got your love
Who's got your love
Who's got your love
