Every day in the week, I'm in a different city
If I stay too long, people try to pull me down
They talk about me like a dog, talkin' 'bout the clothes I wear
But they don't realize they're the ones who's square

Hey, and that's why
You can't hold me down
I don't want to be down
I gotta move on, ow!

Stone free, to do what I please
Stone free, to ride the breeze
Stone free, I can't stay
I got to, got to, got to get away right now
Yeah
Alright
Listen to this, baby

A woman here, a woman there, try to keep me in a plastic cage
But they don't realize it's so easy to break
Oh, but sometimes I get hot, I can feel my heart kinda runnin' hot
That's when I got to move before I get caught

Hey, and that's why, listen to me, baby
You can't hold me down
I don't want to be tied down
I gotta be free, ow!

I said stone free, do what I please
Stone free, to ride the breeze
Stone free, I can't stay
Got to, got to, got to get away
Yeah, ow
Tear me loose, baby

Yeah
Ow
Uh
Hey

I said stone free, to ride the breeze
Stone free, do what I please
Stone free, I can't stay
Stone free, I got to, I got to get away

Stone free (I'm gonna leave her right now)
Stone free (Don't try to hold me back, ow)
Stone free (I'm goin' on down the highway, yeah)
Stone free

Stone free (Move it on, bye, bye baby, ow)
Stone free
