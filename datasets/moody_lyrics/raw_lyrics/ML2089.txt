When I make it, I'll be on time...
Uh!
Gonna take what I want
And give you a piece of my mind

You black hearts waited too long
Just to see me fall down
Fall down, Fall down
You black hearts won't be around
Just to see me fall down

Your heart's on fire
So come on come brighter
Your heart's on fire
So come on come brighter

Your heart's on fire but you're cold to the touch
I know you want it, but you love yourself too much
Your heart's on fire but your head isn't right
You better leave it, I ain't ever giving up
Hey hey-yeah!

When I make it, I'll be on time...
Yeah!
Well you might say I'm crazy
But, uh, ooh I'm out of my mind!

But, uh, excuse me black hearts
Will you tell me?
Who's up and who is down
Are you waiting for me to fall down?

Your heart's on fire
So come on come brighter
Your heart's on fire
So come on come brighter

Your heart's on fire but you're cold to the touch
I know you want it, but you love yourself too much
Your heart's on fire but your head isn't right
You better leave it, I ain't ever giving up

So come on, come on, come on...
Ha... yeah!

(Guitar solo)

Your heart's on fire but you're cold to the touch
I know you want it, but you love yourself too much
Your heart's on fire but your head isn't right
You better leave it, I ain't ever giving up!
Hey hey hey!

Oh!
