This tired city was somebody's dream
Billboard horizon as black as they seem
A four-level highway across the land
We're building a home for the family of man

Prices are rising, the devil's to pay
Moving the mountain that got in the way
Prayer books and meetings to find a plan
Deciding the fate of the family of man

So hard 
Whatever are we coming to
Yes, it's so hard 
With so little time and so much to do

Memories replacing the love that we lost
Burning our bridges as soon as they're crossed
Factories built where the rivers ran
Time's running out for the family of man

So hard

So hard
So hard
So hard, family of man
So hard, family of man (come on now, let this show)
So hard, family of man (come see now, family of man)
So hard, family of man (head on out, let this show)
So hard, family of man (come on now, let this show)
So hard, family of man (come on now, time this showed)
So hard, family of man (come on now, time this showed)
So hard, family of man (come on now, let this show)
