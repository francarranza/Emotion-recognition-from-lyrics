Hey, how've you been? Good to see you again 
Gee, it's been a long time 
How's that new man, Mom and Dad 
Since I told you goodbye? 
Now I'm still the same, still raisin' Cain 
Nobody's worried 'bout me 
I come and& I go, just as I please 
Since I set myself free 

But I can't win for losin' you 
I just can't get over you 
Bein' footloose and fancy free 
Ain't all it's cracked up to be 
And the grass ain't no greener 
Here on the other side 
I might win a heart or two
But I can't win for losin' you 

Well I'm on my way, there's so much to say 
Lord knows that I've had my time 
Girl, you can bet I'll never forget 
When you used to be mine 

But I can't win for losin' you 
I just can't get over you 
Bein' footloose and fancy free 
Ain't all it's cracked up to be 
And the grass ain't no greener 
Here on the other side 
I might win a heart or two
But I can't win for losin' you
