I've felt the thunder speak of Your name
And I've watched the lightning, your glory proclaim
I've gazed upon mountains that testify of Your fame
And I've heard the waves on the ocean echo their refrain

This is my song, my song to the King
And I stand in awe of Your majesty
And I don't have much, but I give everything
This is my song, song to my King

It seems all creation, oh it's longing for You
From here to the farthest star they're worshipping You
And who am I God that You are mindful of me
I'm simple in heart, simple in song, I'm a small offering

But this is my song, my song to the King
And I stand in awe of Your majesty
And I don't have much but I give everything
(Don't have much)
For this is my song, my song to the King

It's all the creation hesitates now
(Hesitates now)
And all of the angels stops singing now
(Stops singing now)
As the King of all glory listens to my song

This is my song, my song to my King
And I stand in awe of Your majesty
And I don't have much but I give everything
For this is my song, song to my King

Is my song to my King
My song to my King
