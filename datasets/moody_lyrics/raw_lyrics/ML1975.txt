You've got your ball, you've got your chain
Tied to me tight, tie me up again
Who's got their claws in you my friend?
Into your heart, I'll beat again

Sweet like candy to my soul
Sweet you rock and sweet you roll
Lost for you, I'm so lost for you

Oh, when you come crash into me
And I come into you
I come into you
In a boy's dream
In a boy's dream

Oh, I kiss you just so I know
In your eyes, love, it glows so
I'm bare boned and crazy for you

Oh, when you come crash into me, yeah
Baby, please come crash into me
In a boy's dream
In a boy's dream

If I've gone overboard
Then I'm begging you to forgive me in my haste
When I'm holding you up, girl
Close to me

Oh, and you come crash into me, baby
And I come into you

Oh, hike up your skirt a little more
And show the world to me
Yeah, hike up your skirt a little more
And show your world to me
In a boy's dream
In a boy's dream

I watch you there by the window
And I stare at you wear nothing
But you wear it so well
Tied up and twisted, the way Id like to be
For you, for me
Come crash into me

Oh yeah
Come crash into me
Crash into me
Crash into me
Crash into me
Oh

Well, I'm the king of the castle
You're the dirty rascal, crash into me
Won't you come crash into me, baby
The way you do, the way you do
Oh yes, I see the way you crash into me
Oh yes, I see the way you come and crash into me

Crash into me
Crash into me, baby
Crash into me, baby
