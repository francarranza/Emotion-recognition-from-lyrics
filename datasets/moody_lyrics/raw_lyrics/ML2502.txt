It's been so long since I've had a smile
I've been down for such a long while
If you could cheer me up, I could learn to love you
You kiss me now and I'll turn away
I think I'm still kissing yesterday
If you could cheer me up, I could learn to love you
So love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Cheer me up, c'mon and cheer me up
I don't wanna spend the rest of my days in yesterdays daydream... no...
It looked bad, but it felt good
I feel my heart though you're knocking on wood
If you chould cheer me up, I could learn to love you
So generous, on being kind
With selfishness in the back of my mind
If you chould cheer me up, I could learn to love you
So love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one that can make me happy
So love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one that can make me happy
Cheer me up, c'mon and cheer me up
I don't wanna spend the rest of my days in yesterdays daydream
Don't wanna spend the rest of my days in yesterdays promises
It's been so long since I've had a smile
I stayed sad for such a long while
If you chould cheer me up, I could learn to love you
So love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Cheer me up, c'mon and cheer me up
