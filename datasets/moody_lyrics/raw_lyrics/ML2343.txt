(Suicidal Tendencies)

(From F.N.G. compilation, 1992)

Lying on my back, wheeled under blinding light
Shackled restraints resist my attempted fight
The scalpels hovers over me, the incision is made
Once again they're watching me, no new sensation, just frustration 

They said it was for science
But I'm the human guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig

My sleep has been altered, I open my eyes
The nightmare continues, I see through their lies
The papers keep turning, the tests never ends
Once again they're watching me, no new sensation, just frustration

They said it was for science
But I feel like the human guinea pig

Time may have passed on, but I won't soon forget
The old sensation, pure frustration of a human guinea, guinea pig
