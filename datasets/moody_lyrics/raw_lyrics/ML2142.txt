Do I want you for my baby
Do I want you by my side
Do I wanna run and kiss your lips
Say you're my loving guy - oh oh...
(Do I love you)
(Yes I love you)
Do I need your arms around me
Do I live my life for you
Do I always feel so warm each time
I look in your eyes of blue - oh oh...
(Do I love you)
(Yes I love you)
Oh Oh

And do I need you every minute of the day
And would I die if you should ever go away
And does it mean so much to feel your tender touch
Do I love you (Do I love you)
Really love you (really love you)
Oh I swear I'm gonna get you if takes me all my life
I'll hope and pray and dream and scheme
'Cause I'm gonna be your wife
(Do I love you)
(Yes I love you)

Do I love you
Yes I love you
Do I love you
Yes I love you
