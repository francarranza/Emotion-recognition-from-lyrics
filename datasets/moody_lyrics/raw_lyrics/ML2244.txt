This can't be love because I feel so well
No sobs, no sorrows, no sighs
This can't be love I get no dizzy spells
My head is not in the sky

My heart does not stand still just hear it beat
This is too sweet to be love
This can't be love because I feel so well
But still I love to look in your eyes

My heart does not stand still just hear it beat
This is too sweet to be love
This can't be love because I feel so well
But still I love to look in your eyes
I love to look in your eyes
