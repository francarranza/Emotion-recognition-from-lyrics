Vince Gill & Patrick Williams

I'll have a blue Christmas without you;
I'll be so blue thinking about you.
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me.

I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain;
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin',
You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white,
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.

I'll have a blue Christmas without you;
I'll be so blue thinking about you.
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me.

I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain;
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin',
You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white,
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas...
