It's a matter of time
It's a matter of luck
It's a factor of chance
Till I self-destruct
You fire at random
I'm under attack
Strapped in and freewheeling
Flying off the track

I want to be your time bomb (Is it on, is it off, reply)
Let me be your time bomb baby (Is it on, is it off, reply)
I want to be your time bomb (Is it on, is it off, reply)
Please let me be your time bomb baby (Is it on, is it off, reply)

Everywhere there is danger
Absolutely for real
Subliminal feelings
Too strong to conceal
Unscramble your program
My turn to unload
Unbelievably certain
Guaranteed to explode
