Now there's something coming through the air that softly reminds me
Tonight I'll park out on the hill and wait until they find me
Here slipping through the ether, a voice is coming through
So keep me in your heart tonight and I'll save my love for you.

So turn up your radio and, darling, dial me in close
We're riding on the airwaves and we're traveling coast to coast
Over river and highway, your voice comes clear and true
Though we're far apart tonight, I'll save my love for you.

Hold me in your arms and our doubts won't break us
If we open up our hearts, love won't forsake us
Let's let the music take us and carry us home.

There's a prayer coming through the air like a shot straight through my heart
Tearing open the evening sky, tearing me apart
Now I'll ride that signal down the line till I'm home again with you
So turn up your radio and I'll save my love for you
Turn up your radio and I'll save my love for you.
