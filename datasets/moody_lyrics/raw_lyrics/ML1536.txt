Standin' at the crossroads
Tryin' to read the signs
To tell me which way I should go to find the answer
And all the time I know
Plant your love and let it grow

Let it grow, let it grow
Let it blossom, let it flow
In the sun, the rain, the snow
Love is lovely, let it grow

Lookin' for a reason
To check out on my mind
It's so hard to get a friend that I can count on
There's nothin' left to show
Plant your love and let it grow

Let it grow, let it grow
Let it blossom, let it flow
In the sun, the rain, the snow
Love is lovely, so let it grow
Let it grow

Time is gettin' shorter
There's much for you to do
Only ask and you will get what you are needin'
The rest is up to you
Plant your love and let it grow

Let it grow, let it grow
Let it blossom, let it flow
In the sun, the rain, the snow
Love is lovely, let it

Let it grow, let it grow
Let it blossom, let it flow
In the sun, the rain, the snow
Love is lovely, so let it grow
