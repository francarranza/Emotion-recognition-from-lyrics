If you want my lovin'
If you really do
Don't be afraid, baby, just ask
You know I'm gonna give it to you
Oh, and I do declare (I do)
I wanna see you with it
Stretch out your arms
Little boy, you're gonna get it

'Cause I love you
(Baby, baby, baby, I love you)
There ain't no doubt about it
Baby, I love you
(Baby, baby, baby, I love you)
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
Baby, I love you

If you really wanna kiss me
Go right ahead, I don't mind
All you got to do is snap your fingers
And I'll come a-runnin', I ain't lyin' (I ain't lyin')
Oh, what'cha want, little boy, you know you got it
I'd deny my own self before I'd see you without it

'Cause I love you
(Baby, baby, baby, I love you)
There ain't no doubt about it
Baby, I love you
(Baby, baby, baby, I love you)
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
Baby, I love you

Someday you might want to run away
And leave me sittin' here cryin'
But if it's all the same to you, baby
I'm gonna stop you from sayin' goodbye

Baby I love you
(Baby, baby, baby, I love you)
Baby I need ya
(Baby, baby, baby, I love you)
Said I want ya
(Baby, baby, baby, I love you)
Got to have you baby
(Baby, baby, baby, I love you)
Don't let your neighbors
(Baby, baby, baby, I love you)
Tell you I don't want you
(Baby, baby, baby, I love you)
Don't let yo low-down friends
(Baby, baby, baby, I love you)
Tell ya I don't need ya
