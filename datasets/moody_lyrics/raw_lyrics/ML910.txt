Me and baby brother
Used to run together
Me and baby brother
Used to run together

Welcome one another
Headed for the corner
Welcome one another
Headed for the corner

Shiftin' on his mind
Is like drinking funky wine
By the river
Chippin' on his mind
Is like drinking funky wine
By the river

Me and baby brother
Used to run together
Me and baby brother
Used to run together

Welcome one another
Headed for the corner
Welcome one another
Headed for the corner

I remember the day
We used to fight together
I remember the day, yeah
We used to fight together

Me and baby brother
Used to run together
Me and baby brother
Used to run together

Hang on, baby brother, oh
They call it law and order
Hey, hey, hey

Come back, baby brother
Come back, baby brother
Come back, baby brother
Come back, baby brother
You're my baby brother
You're my baby brother
Come back, baby brother
Come back, baby brother
Come back, baby brother
You're my baby brother
You're my baby brother
Come back, baby brother
Come back, baby brother
Come back, baby brother
