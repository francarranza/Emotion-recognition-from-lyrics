Put your hands together for this

You don't love me pretty baby
You don't love me, yes I know
You don't love me pretty baby
You don't love me, yes I know
Well if you leave me pretty baby
Don't you know you're gonna hurt me so

Well I'm gonna tell my mother
I'm gonna talk to my father too
Well I'm gonna tell my sweet mother
I'm gonna talk to my father too
Well I'm gonna tell everybody
What those young girls will do for you

I'm gonna tell my mother
I'm gonna talk to my father too
Yes I'm gonna tell my sweet mother
I'm gonna have a word with my father too
Well I'm gonna tell everybody
What those young girls will do to you

Well, if I lie pretty baby
If I don't see you no more
Lord, if I lie pretty baby
If I never see you no more
Well, if you think I'll be your fool, Lord
You better be on your merry way
