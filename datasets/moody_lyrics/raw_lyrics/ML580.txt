It took me lightly like a quiet boost
Another piece of candy from your favorite neighborhood corner store
Surely shoulda sold the weight
A heavy burden to carry the bare soul slaved
They don't wanna have a thing to do with
Can't blame me cause you look
Can't name 'em 'cause they shook
Took over some whip protect state
Which you can't walk
Fuck around with me more
Make you look like you're white in a Harlem shaking contest
I hone this to find this so close to finest
Fuck grammar, ill-mannered
Don't start with spank

Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is

Oh ease up mother fucker, take a breath
Who will it be, I'm more than more than less
Oh ease up mother fucker, take a breath
You look beat now, now I suggest you take a rest

Can't say what I will or won't do
It's just the height
You might want to stay on your toes to
Secure a full view
For scoop as you contagiously move to assume
Why you assume
I'm feeling uneasy
My past is a broken sham
My thoughts but my guts don't even believe me
She don't believe me, it's like dude can't see me
Got a whole 'nother study that I'm constantly feeling
Ain't nothing much that's to ever such 'n' such
Such so much to clean nuttin
But nigga I'm really touched

What was I drinking?
(From another with a boppin nigga
If you didn't pull me back, spitting on his new shoes)

What was he thinking?
(Man I wonder, do I smile too much?
Yes, you too can get fucked up)

Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is

Tell me with it

I'm sick with it, I stick with it and in the end
All these niggas gonna get with it
Now tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is

Tell me with it

I'm sick with it, I stick with it
And in the end all these niggas gonna get with it
Now tell me what it looks like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it looks like, tell me what it is

(Sit the fuck... there ain't no dancing, no dancing)

My tongue is the drum
My mind's the machine
Now, it's grim fantastic extremes
Fall victim to this think tank-M16
Sound, shot, fix, fit, Crease, grease, then clean

My tongue is the drum
My mind's the machine
Now, it's grim fantastic extremes
Fall victim to this think tank-M16
Sound, shot, fix, fit, Crease, grease, then clean

Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is

Tell me with it

I'm sick with it, I stick with it
And in the end all these niggas gonna get with it
Now tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is

Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me with it

I'm sick with it, I stick with it
And in the end all these niggas gonna get with it

I'm sick with it, I stick with it
And in the end all these niggas gonna get with it
I'm sick with it, I stick with it
And in the end all these niggas gonna get with it
