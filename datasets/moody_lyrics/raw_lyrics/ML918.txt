OK, I'm the one who took you for granted
I've made my mistakes, wake up let's not
Break up

Thrill me you've got a love so strong
Thrill me you really turn me on
Thrill me wait till tomorrow night
Thrill me I'm gonna treat you right

You said that I would never let you be alone
How many times have you been on your own
Worked all the days to find the things you try to do
If only my heart will never let you through
Because you

Thrill me you've got a love so strong
Thrill me you just can't do me wrong
Thrill me wait till tomorrow night
Thrill me I'm gonna treat you right

The truth is you've gone and left me on my own
How can I face the fact you're really gone
Love was a phase we'd have to pray to make it true
If only my heart would've never let you through
Because you

Thrill me you've got a love so strong
Thrill me you really turn me on
Thrill me wait till tomorrow night
Thrill me I'm gonna treat you right
