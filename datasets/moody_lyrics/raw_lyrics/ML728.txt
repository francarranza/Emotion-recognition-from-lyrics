So many days since you went away
I often think of you night and day
But I know that someday, someday darling
I won't be trouble no more

Trouble, trouble and misery
Is about to get the best of me
But I know that someday, oh someday darling
I won't be trouble no more

I told you my story, I sang my song
About you leaving baby, you know that's wrong
But oh, someday, someday darling
I won't be trouble no more
