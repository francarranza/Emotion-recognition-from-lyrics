(Beginning x2)
I love things about her
I love the way she treat me
I love the way she fuck me
I love the way she suck me

(Gucci)
I'm a trapaholic
All I do is ball
Tear the mall down, naw trick
Don't flag me down see me down town rarri
I didn't mean to shit on you excuse me sorry
Verse so slick make my video marvelous
Polo to the floor Ralph down like carlton
Try the CEO they gone put you on a carton
I don't mean no harm but my diamonds are dumb
Plenty rocks on my arm
Me and Rocko the Don, East Atlanta's a slum
Where I'm from got a gun in the club havin' fun
And after its done no more coaches to call it
After party bachelor party they shoulda called it

I love things about her (but don't love her)
I love the way she treat me (but don't love her)
I love the way she fuck me (but don't love her)
I love the way she suck me (still don't love her)

(Rocko)

I like it 'cause she groovin
Love to see her naked
I love to watch her move it
I like her she the coolest
Good head on her shoulders
I love the way she use it

Love the way she suck me
Love how every time we play she catch it like rugby

I love she know what's up with me
She love me 'cause I'm gutta
I like a lot about her though still don't love her
Still super cool though

Super swag carrots match all my bitches love me

I love things about her (but don't love her)
I love the way she treat me (but don't love her)

(Webbie)

Infatuated with money free boosie boo the streets crazy
