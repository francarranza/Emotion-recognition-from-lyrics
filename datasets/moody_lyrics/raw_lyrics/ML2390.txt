Oh baby, don't you know I suffer?
Oh baby, can you hear me moan?
You caught me under false pretenses
How long before you let me go?

Oo-ah, you set my soul alight
Oo-ah, you set my soul alight
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive
(Oo-ah, you set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the (into the supermassive)
(Oo-ah, you set my soul)

I thought I was a fool for no one
But oh baby, I'm a fool for you
You're the Queen of the superficial
But how long before you tell the truth?

Oo-ah, you set my soul alight
Oo-ah, you set my soul alight

Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive
(Oo-ah, you set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the (into the supermassive)
(Oo-ah, you set my soul)

(Supermassive black hole)
(Supermassive black hole)
(Supermassive black hole)
(Supermassive black hole)

Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive
(Oo-ah, you set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the (into the supermassive)
(Oo-ah, you set my soul)

(Supermassive black hole)
(Supermassive black hole)
(Supermassive black hole)
(Supermassive black hole)
