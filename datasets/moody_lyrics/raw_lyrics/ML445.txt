Every night I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms

'Cause I want a girl
To call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover where are you
With a love oh so true
And a hand that I can hold
To feel you near as I grow old

'Cause I want a girl
To call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Someday, I don't know how
I hope she'll hear my plea
Some way I don't know how
She'll bring her love to me

Dream lover until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Till all my lover's dreams come true

'Cause I want a girl
To call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Till all my lover's dreams come true

'Cause I want a girl
To call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Please don't make me dream alone
I beg you don't make me dream alone
No, I don't want to dream alone
No
