All the world is a story
All the world is a stage
All the world is a canvas
All the world is a page
All the world is a horizon
All the world is a field of dreams
All the world is an open doorway
All the world is a place for me

(Rit.)
To be Your voice
To be Your touch
To give an answer
To show Your love
To hold out hope
To offer peace
To shine Your light for everyone to see
In all the world

All the world is a someone
All the world is a dance
All the world is a moment
All the world is a chance

(Rit)
You are amazing mercy
You are undying grace
I want the world to see how wonderful You are
Upon my face

(Rit)
