Have yourself 
A merry little Christmas 
Let your heart be light 
From now on 
Our troubles 
Will be out of sight 

Have yourself 
A merry little Christmas 
Make the Yule-tide gay 
From now on 
Our troubles 
Will be miles away 

Here we are as in olden days 
Happy golden days of yore 
Faithful friends 
Who are dear to us 
Gather near to us once more 

Through the years 
We all will be together 
If the Fates allow 
Hang a shining star 
Upon the highest bough 
And have yourself 
A merry little Christmas now
