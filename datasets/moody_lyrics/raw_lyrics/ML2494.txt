How do you know what you can be
If you can't see where you are going?
What breaks the silence?
Misery can make you see where you belong
It's a dangerous stage but the show must go on

Why do you lie, why do you lie?
Would you betray your soul?
Why do you lie, why do you lie?
Don't let your weakness show
You just might be the last to know

Freedom is such a loaded word
So full of hurt and such aplomb
Loneliness saunters in its breeze
Like a disease it drags along
The time of your life can't be had for a song

Why do you lie, why do you lie?
Would you betray your soul?
Why do you lie, why do you lie?
Don't let your weakness show
You just might be the last to know

Why do you lie, why do you lie?
Would you betray your soul?
Why do you lie, why do you lie?
Don't let your weakness show

Why do you lie, why do you lie?
Only the meek follow
Why do you lie, why do you lie?
Trample the fear below
You might just be the last to know
