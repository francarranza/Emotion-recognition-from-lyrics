Put it in my hand
Tell me how much pressure it takes to get you off

Give it all give 'em hell that's your birth Right
Back in grade school that's where I learned to street fight
I like straight edge rockside up bunker up
Sorted it out for the Highlife now you're stuck
Setting skin fake tits mutilation
Dick sucking, lips for no infertration

Uh ha x9
It's a mad mad world
With every dizzy turn
It's a mad mad world
Watch out, you might get burned
It's a mad mad world
It's a mad mad world

Some believe that you'd have to breathe hard
You've got to believe to shelter your needs
It's not about livin' your lies
When you go down on your knees for your fantasies
So let them show you their your cards
You know that they will, they always will
Some of them gotta breathe hard
You've got to believe to shelter your needs

Pharmaceutical population
You've got your red blue ???
Cops in line first bops and foes
Here's your present for putting on a good show

Uh ha x9
It's a mad mad world
With every dizzy turn
It's a mad mad world
Watch out, you might get burned
It's a mad mad world
It's a mad mad world

Some believe that you'd have to breathe hard
You've got to believe to shelter your needs
It's not about livin' your lies
When you go down on your knees for your fantasies
So let them show you their your cards
You know that they will, they always will
Some of them gotta breathe hard
You've got to believe to shelter your needs

Uh ha x9
It's a mad mad world
With every dizzy turn
It's a mad mad world
Watch out, you might get burned
It's a mad mad world
It's a mad mad world ...
