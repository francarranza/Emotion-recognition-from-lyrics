Now, it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now, the Sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now, the Moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you

Mm, mm
Mm

Close your eyes, and I'll close mine (now, it's time to say good night)
Good night, sleep tight
Now, the Sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you


Good night
Good night, everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night
