I will never bother you
I will never promise to
I will never follow you
I will never bother you
Never speak a word again
I will crawl away for good

I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
I always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail

Pain!
Pain!
Pain!
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right

I'm so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide
Let's talk about someone else
The stinging soon begins to melt
Nothing really bothers her
She just wants to love himself

I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
I always knew to come like this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to feel

Pain!
Pain!
Pain!
Pain!
Pain!
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right 
You know you're right
You know you're right 
You know you're right
You know you're right 
You know you're right
You know you're right
