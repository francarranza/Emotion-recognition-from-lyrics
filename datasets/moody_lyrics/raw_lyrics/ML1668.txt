I wish you a Merry Christmas; 
I wish you a Merry Christmas; 
I wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

Oh, bring us some figgy pudding; 
Oh, bring us some figgy pudding; 
Oh, bring us some figgy pudding and bring it out here.

We won't go until we got some; 
We won't go until we got some; 
We won't go until we got some, so bring some out here

We wish you a Merry Christmas; 
We wish you a Merry Christmas; 
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

Oh, bring us some figgy pudding; 
Oh, bring us some figgy pudding; 
Oh, bring us some figgy pudding and bring it out here.

We wish you a Merry Christmas; 
We wish you a Merry Christmas; 
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
