You're the kind 
When you love you love with all your might 
And you're the kind 
I would dream about at night 
Now I'm the lucky one
Baby, I'm the lucky one 

You're the kind 
That I want to be with in the dark and 
You're the kind who is capturing my heart 
And I'm the lucky one
Baby, I'm the lucky one 

And I have never been the one to fall in love so soon
But I could never face another night or day without you
Baby, I'm the lucky one 

You're the kind 
With poetry and valentines and 
You're the kind 
Who will never ever leave 
And I'm the lucky one
The luckiest girl, my my baby
Baby I'm the lucky one

And I have never been the one to fall in love so soon
But I could never face another night or day without you
I'm the lucky one 
Baby I'm the lucky one

I said, doo doo doo
The lucky one
Doo doo doo doo
My my baby
Doo doo doo
The lucky one
