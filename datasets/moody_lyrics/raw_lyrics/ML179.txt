Somewhere over the rainbow way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star and wake up when the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me!

Somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow why then, oh why can't I?

If happy little blue birds fly across the rainbow
Why oh why can't I?
