I don't want to be shy
Can't stand it anymore
I just want to say "Hi"
To the one I love

Cherry blossom girl

I feel sick all day long
From not being with you
I just want to go out
Every night for a while

Cherry blossom girl

Tell me why can't it be true

I never talk to you
People say that I should
I can pray everyday
For the moment to come

Cherry blossom girl

I just want to be sure
When I will come to you
When the time will be gone
You will be by my side

Cherry blossom girl

Tell me why can't it be true
Tell me why can't it be true

Cherry blossom girl
Cherry blossom girl

I'll never love again
Can I say that to you
Will you run away
If I try to be true

Cherry blossom girl

Cherry blossom girl
I'll always be there for you
That means no time to waste
Whenever there's a chance
Cherry blossom girl

Tell me why can't it be true
Tell me why can't it be true
