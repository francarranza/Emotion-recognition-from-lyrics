Not to us oh God 
But to Your name all Glory 
We give thanks and praise 
To You alone forever 
Praise Him all the earth 
All creation bows to You 
Nations stand in awe 
He is the King of Glory 
To You oh Lord 
You reign in heaven and on earth 
To You alone 
As the earth is filled with the knowledge 
Of the Lord 
Call upon His name 
The orphans and the widows 
He'll lift you up again 
And shower you with mercy 
Bless You all my soul 
Robed with strength and majesty 
The Lion and the Lamb 
Together come and worship 
To You oh Lord 
You reign in heaven and on earth 
To You alone 
As the earth is filled with Your wonder 
To You oh Lord 
You reign in heaven and on earth 
To You alone 
As the earth is filled with the knowledge 
Of the Lord 
All to You 
Both now and evermore 
Come and drink again 
Be filled with living water 
Call upon His name 
He is the King of Glory
