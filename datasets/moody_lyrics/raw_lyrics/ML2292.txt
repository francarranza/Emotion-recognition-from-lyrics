Waves wash over everything on the ground
The sun's reflection blocked by a sound
The sound of life just as it's ripped apart
I'd say these words to you but fear that my heart would stay away
You took my hand, so I showed you the place
Now it's grown empty you can see it in my face
Then the sound and it rips me in half
Who'd say these things to you if it wasn't meant to last not today

Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

What comes out nails your head to the floor
I say I'm sorry as I'm walking out the door

Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
