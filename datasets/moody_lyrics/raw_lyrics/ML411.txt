If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you each step of the way

And I will always love you
Oh I will always love you

Bittersweet memories
That's all I am taking with me
Goodbye, please don't cry
We both know that I'm not what you need

But I will always love you
Oh I will always love you

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope that you have all that you ever dreamed of
And I wish you joy and happiness
But above all of this, I wish you love

And I will always love you
Oh I will always love you
I will always love you
