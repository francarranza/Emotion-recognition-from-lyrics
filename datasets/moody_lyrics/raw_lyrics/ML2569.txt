(Thomas william damphier, rick carnes)

I walk into the kitchen
The silverware is gone
The furniture is missing
I guess you got it all uhuh
This is where it ought to hurt
Seems like every time you leave me
You try to think of something worse

I can't even get the blues no more
I try to worry like I did before
And nothing happens when I walk the floor
So what am I supposed to do
I toss and turn but then I fall asleep

I'm going under but it's not too deep
You want to hurt me but it's just no use
I can't even get the blues

Well this time ain't no different
The sun's up in the sky
Sitting on the back porch
Clouds are rolling by
Oh this is where it ought to rain
But it doesn't really matter
To me it's all about the same

(You try and hurt me)
