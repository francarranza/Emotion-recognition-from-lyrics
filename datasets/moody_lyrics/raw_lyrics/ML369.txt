Said you'd always feel like
Then everything just changed in the blink of an eye
I could never leave like
There was anything left to leave behind

You were right there, I was lonely
And I could let you down

Someday you'll say
There's always been a part of me
Feeling like my heart is so far away
Searching for a part of me
Looking for somebody to blame

Said you'd always be around
Then you leave it all out on the line
I'd tear it all down
Just to watch you change what you know was right

You were right there, and I was lonely
And I could let you down

I need you to hear
Everything I wanted to say
