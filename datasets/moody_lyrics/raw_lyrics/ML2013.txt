(McDonald/Harris/Ingram)

So many will worry
On this christmas day
But many just goes so far anyway
When the shopping is over
It's all said and done
The story's the same for everyone
'Cause one gift
Already given that will stand the test of time
Love and mercy
Sweet forgiveness
A gift from god the father to all mankind

Hallelujah
(Repeat)

Christmas is special
The time that we share
The joy and the music fill the air
But let us remember
The message is clear
He sent us a savior to draw us near
With one love
From the beginning
That will span the rest of time
A child is born to a world that lies waiting
To prove our father's love for all mankind

Hallelujah
(Repeat)

This good news
The greatest gift we share
So let us have no fear
As we sing hallelujah

'Cause one gift
Already given
That will stand the test of time

Love and mercy
Sweet forgiveness
A gift from god the father to all mankind

Hallelujah
