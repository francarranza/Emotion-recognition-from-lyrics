Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
A long way from home
A long way from home, mm mm

Sometimes I wish that I could fly
Like a bird up in the sky
Oh, sometimes I wish I could fly
Fly like a bird up in the sky
Such a long way from home
Such a long way from home

Sometimes I feel like freedom is near
Sometimes I feel like freedom is near

Sometimes I feel like freedom is near
But we're so far from home
You know we're so far from home

Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
A long way from home
Oh such a long way from home
I'm long way from home
Such a long way from home
