Blue ain't just a word it's a feeling a feeling of loneliness that I can feel right now
Love has looked at me but tried to change me
I wished that love would take me just for what I am
Just for what I am I want someone to love me
Someone who won't expect me to feel like that old mem'ry
Just for what they see just for being me
I want someone to love me just for what I am

Cry ain't just a sound it's a sadness
A sadness that lives with me and follows me around
Love wants me to be someone I can't be
I wished that love would take me just for what I am
Just for what I am...
I want someone to love me just for what I am
