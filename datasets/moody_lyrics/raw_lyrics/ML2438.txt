Count on every finger
Every little thing I'm sure of
Hold them up before my eyes
See the one that holds a pure love
Place this above your heart
Upon your skin
Feel the power of the love
The strength deep within

Teach your children well
Love, respect and honesty

One brings me hope in handfuls
Two who give me joy and laughter
Three to make my life complete
And four who make me happy
One to sing her songs of praise
Two and three to dance at twilight
Four who give me more and more
Four who make me happy

Count on every minute
Every moment shared together
Wrap them deep inside your heart
Keep them safe forever

So teach your parents well
Love, respect, how to be free

One brings me hope in handfuls
Two who give me joy and laughter
Three to make my life complete
And four who make me happy
One to sing her songs of praise
Two and three to dance at twilight
Four who give me more and more
Four who make me happy

Bring me joy
Bring me light
Bringing hope
Bringing all I ever needed
Give me strength to keep me
Going on and going on and going on and on and on

One brings me hope in handfuls
Two who give me joy and laughter
Three to make my life complete
And four who make me happy
One to sing her songs of praise
Two and three to dance at twilight
Four who give me more and more
Four who make me happy.
