I declare war on the world
War in outer space
I declare war in a nutshell
War all over the place

I declare war on every government
War against all odds
I declare war on your inner sanctum
On your bloodthirsty gods

War on the axis of morons
All out war on complacent consent
I declare war on the war against drugs
Rape and slaughter of the innocent

War on Big Brother
Warmongers and profiteers
War on your Dogma Dubya
Armageddon's engineers

War in a heartbeat
I declare war on so-called civilization
World trade globalization
Organized disinformation

War on ambassadors of pretense
War on MTV and CNN
McDonald's Walt Disney and Bethlehem
On Christina Britney and Eminem

I declare war on the world of anti-choice
On violent unilaterality
On the amassment of murderous high-tech toys
And all crimes against humanity

War on the moral majority
On corporate dotcom imperialism
On mindlessly bumbling stupidity
And police-state terrorism

World War Three - be all that you can be
