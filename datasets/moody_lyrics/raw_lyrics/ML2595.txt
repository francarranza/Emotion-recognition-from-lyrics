Sweet Leilani
Heavenly flower
Nature fashioned roses kissed with dew
And then she placed them in a bower
It was the start of you.
Sweet Leilani
Heavenly flower
I dreamed of paradise for two.
You are my paradise completed.
You are my dream come true.

Sweet Leilani
Heavenly flower
Tropic skies are jealous as they shine
I think they're jealous of your blue eyes
Jealous hecause you're mine.
Sweet Leilani
Heavenly flower
I dreamed of paradise for two.
You are my paradise completed.
You are my dream come true.

You are my paradise completed.
You are my dream come true.
