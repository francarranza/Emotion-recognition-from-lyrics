Let's do this!

Fake and fall, stop and stall
Take it all back, 'cause I'm taking mine
I'm taking mine
Time is up, out of luck
Should'a stood up when you had the time
'Cause you're out of time
Let's do this!
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Lock and load, rock and roll
Bitch, it's all over, you're going down (you're going down)

Get ready to settle the score
And get ready to face the floor
'Cause it's time to remember it
This is war and it's on tonight
So get up and fight (get up and fight)
You've had all your life to run and hide
Now step up!
Now step up!

Let's do this

Second round, going down
How about a little reaction, man?
You can barely stand
Bitch slap, slow attack
Man, that was practically suicide
Next in line
Let's go!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

Get ready to settle the score
And get ready to face the floor
'Cause it's time to remember it
This is war and it's on tonight
So get up and fight (get up and fight)
You've had all your life to run and hide
Now step up!
Now step up!

Let's do this

'Cause we're all about ready to break
You're all about ready to break
You're all about ready to break
You're all about ready to break
This is war and it never ends
So get up, get up, get up
Get up!

You've had all your life to run and hide
Now step up (now step up)
This is war! (and it never ends)
This is war! (and it never ends)
This is war!

Let's do this!
Let's do this! (Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!)
Let's do this!
