I saw three ships come sailing by
On Christmas day, on Christmas day
I saw three ships come sailing by
On Christmas day, on Christmas day

And what was in those ships all three
On Christmas day, on Christmas day?
And what was in those ships all three
On Christmas day, on Christmas day?

The Virgin Mary and Christ were there
On Christmas day, on Christmas day
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there
On Christmas day in the morning

And all the angels in heaven shall sing
On Christmas day, on Christmas day
And all the angels in heaven shall sing
On Christmas day in the morning

Then let us all rejoice and sing
On Christmas day, on Christmas day
Then let us all rejoice and sing
On Christmas day in the morning
