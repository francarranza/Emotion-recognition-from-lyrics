Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be far away

Here we are in the olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years we will all be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough

And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
