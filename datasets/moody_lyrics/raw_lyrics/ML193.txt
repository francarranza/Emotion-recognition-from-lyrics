I keep on fallin' in
In love with you
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes you make me blue

Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin'
Makes me so confused

I keep on fallin' in and out 
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I loved you

Oh, oh, I
Never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain

Just when I think
I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin'
Back in love with you

I keep on fallin' in and out 
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I loved you

Oh baby
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
Fall, fall, fall
Fall, fall

I keep on fallin' in and out 
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I loved you

I'm fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I loved you

I'm fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I loved you
